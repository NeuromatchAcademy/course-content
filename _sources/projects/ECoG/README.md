# Guide to choosing an EEG/ECoG/LFP dataset

*July 5-23, 2021*

New in 2021, we have ECoG datasets from Kai Miller! This is a rare dataset from intracranial electrocorticographic recordings in clinical settings. Please watch Kai Miller's TED talk to familiarize yourself with this type of recording.

* The datasets are more or less at the same difficulty level. All datasets are from the same research group, using the same recording methods and standardized protocols.

* Students can choose one dataset based on their particular interest (sensory / motor / memory / BCI).

* For slightly more advanced groups, you should definitely consider the LFPs from the Steinmetz dataset, which are much better suited for exploratory analyses and a wide diversity topics. They are also better for computational projects, because they provide high-dimensional data (lots of neurons) with lots of trials, and they are well supported at NMA, because the Steinmetz dataset has been well curated and annotated in general.
