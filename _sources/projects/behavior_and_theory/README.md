# Guide to choosing a Behavior And Theory dataset

The behavior and theory datasets and project templates are combined into the same topic. They range from projects focused on data analysis (i.e. the Caltech dataset) to pure theory projects where you implement and study a model like a recurrent neural network. Scroll down to see the project templates.

Pure theory projects are usually pursued by more advanced students. If your group is relatively new to neuroscience, you should consider doing a dataset or behavior project *and* include a theory component to it.

Every group can bring up and discuss theory projects. We have several example project templates for this that include code. However, a theory project can go in any direction.

## Caltech

The Caltech dataset ([youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tDmhmasjPeM)) has pose-tracking data from socially-interacting mice, and is well supported with code and a project template.

## IBL

The IBL dataset ([youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NofrFH8FRZU)) is a visual decision-making task, that is very similar to the one used in the Steinmetz dataset.

## Laquitaine & Gardner, Neuron, 2017

The Laquitaine & Gardner dataset contains behavioral data collected in a motion direction estimation task performed by 12 human subjects. The data include motion direction estimates, reaction times and various task variables recorded for 83,214 trials. The authors varied the strength of sensory evidence (motion coherence) and priors (set of directions) and compared the trial-estimate distribution with the predictions of Bayesian observer models.

## Motor RNN

We built on [Feulner & Clopath, Plos Computational Biology, 2021](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008621) to propose this project. Here we explore how RNN representation dynamics is linked with connectivity structure and task complexity.
