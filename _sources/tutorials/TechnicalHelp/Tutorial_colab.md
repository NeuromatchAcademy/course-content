# Using Google Colab 

If you have access to Google Colab, you can click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of each page to launch it in an interactive environment where you can write and run code.

## Advice for using Colab
*  Make a local copy to your Drive: otherwise changes you make (e.g. notes you take, code you write, etc) will not be saved
*  Do not edit the same colab directly as a group. Unlike Google Docs, one person's version will overwrite another's. If your browser happens to be open, it can overwrite anything that has been done by others since the last version in your browser!
*  Colab does not have version control! Use git for this if you want to collaborate (on a group project colab for example)
