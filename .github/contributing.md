# Reporting issues in Neuromatch Academy content

Thank you very much for helping to make NMA content better!

Please read through these guidelines before reporting your issue.

## Please open issues, not pull requests

What you see on Github is just the tip of the content creation and review iceberg at Neuromatch Academy. Most modifications to content should be made with the original content creators (and potentially reviewers) in the loop, and many are unfamilar with Github. Therefore, while we very much appreciate your willingness and desire to step in and help, **please report all problems with content as issues, not pull requests**. While the course content is being finalized, we will be closing all external pull requests and asking the submitter to reformulate as an issue. This helps us keep the PR queue clear so that we can work efficiently on the high-priority content. Thank you for understanding.

## Guidelines for reporting problems in the tutorial content

### Be courteous

Please remember that the content was produced by humans who volunteered their time and effort to help make NMA a good experience. It is important to fix mistakes, but also important to understand that mistakes are natural. The [NMA code of conduct](http://www.neuromatchacademy.org/code-of-conduct/) applies here too.


### Be clear

It is very important to be as clear and complete in your report as possible. Please make sure that you include:

1. The day code (e.g. W1D2), the tutorial number (e.g. Tutorial 2), and a description of the location in the notebook that is as precise as possible.
2. *Exactly* what it says in the version of the notebook that you are looking at.
3. *Exactly* what you think it should say.
4. (If reporting an issue with the Python code), the exact code that was run and the exact output (error or incorrect value) that occurred.

Point (1) is important so that your issue can be triaged properly and fixed efficiently. Point (2) is important for that reason and because (especially for notebooks that have not been finalized) you may be looking at an outdated version of the content. Point (3) is important because it saves time in the process of understanding the nature and magnitude of the issue. Point (4) may be difficult to implement if you are reporting a problem that one of your students ran into, but please collect and report as much information as feasible.


### Be thorough

- Make sure that you are looking at the most up-to-date version of the content. Because NBViewer often serves an outdated (cached) version of the notebook, please check the Colab version to make sure the issue still exists before you report.
- Please check whether your issue has previously been reported prior to submitting. Issues for tutorials that have already been covered in the course will not be addressed until the course is complete.


### Be organized

- If you find multiple small issues (typos, etc.) in the content, please collate them into a single issue.
- Different content creators are responsible for each day, so issues should be specific to a single day's material.
