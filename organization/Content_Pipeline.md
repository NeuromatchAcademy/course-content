# Neuromatch Academy Content Pipeline

This document sumarizes the pipeline from content creation to publishing, focusing on practical details relating to the Tutorials.


## Content Creation


## Content Review

After Tutorials have been created, they are evaluated by several Reviewers. The review process should focus on the accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness of the content, including videos, prose, math, and code. Ideally, Reviewers will have domain-specific expertise relating to the days that they volunteer to review, although non-experts can provide helpful feedback about clarity and organization. Reviewing and Editing are partially overlapping, but Reviewers should focus on content, not style.

Content Review is organized externally to the GitHub repository using a Google Sheet that tracks the URLs for the latest version of each notebook, the associated Tutorial videos, and the identities of the various parties involved.

Google Colab's commenting feature is the primary medium for the review. Notebooks should be shared with commenting enabled, but do *not* enable third-party editing, as this can lead to loss of work. Be aware that comments apply on a cell-wise basis; to comment about specific lines of code, enable line numbering (`Ctrl-M Ctrl-L`) and reference the number in the comment.
