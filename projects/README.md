# **Project Structure and Schedule**

The NMA projects are conducted over 14 days, beginning on the morning of the ‘second’ curriculum day (W1D2) and ending
W3D4. The first week is about the process of forming a project. The second two weeks are for executing a project. You
are highly encouraged, but not required to participate in a group project. Please think about your project partners, if
you decide to join a group, please try to see the projec through to the end! On the last day, some projects will be
presented and we will be organizing a 'poster' session!

 <!-- It is important to note that project time can begin:

- TimeZones 1A, 2A, 3A: Project Day 2 is the morning of course Day 3
- TimeZones 1B, 2B, 3B: Project Day 2 is partly the afternoon of Course Day 2, and partly the morning of Course Day 3.
- TimeZones 1C, 2C, 3C: Project Day 2 is the afternoon of Course Day 2. -->

Daily project time can be:

 - A zones — Early — 4h before content
 - B zones — Split — 2h before and after content
 - C zones — Late — 4h after content

### Week One

Week one is about brainstorming, generating questions, refining ideas and coming up with a simple project proposal. By
the end of project day four, project groups should form, with a specific project proposal idea including a question,
data set and planned techniques. These will be collected on day five and used to match projects with Mentors.

We suggest using the [Miro](https://miro.com) collaborative board for
brainstorming. The project days are:

* **Project Day 1** — General discussion — (zone A: Tues; zone B: Mon-Tues; zone C: Mon)
  * Extended ice-breaker. Students get to know about each other's research interests.

* **Project Day 2** — Project Structure
    * Videos: from topic to scientific questions
    * Videos: intros to data sets
    * Videos: overview of course content
    * Pod brainstorm: dreaming big ideas
    * We suggest using [Miro](https://miro.com/) collaborative board for brainstorming

* **Project Day 3** — Refinement (with Mentors)
  * In temporary groups of 3–5 students
  * Develop projects from idea to plan

* **Project Day 4** — Refinement (with Mentors)
  * In temporary groups of 3-5 students
  * Refine, specify techniques
  * Write short proposal uestion
      * What is the quesion?
      * What data set will you use?
      * What analysis or models will you use?
      * What do you predict you will find?

* **Project Day 5** — Groups (led by TAs) — (zone A: Mon; zone B: Fri-Mon; zone C: Fri)
  * Organize into final project groups (projects and the groups will be matched to Mentors)
  * Projects are submitted for neuromatching via [AirTable](https://airtable.com/shr8F7Tz0wf0x0L7A "Project proposal form")
  * HARD DEADLINE OF W1D5 (Friday, local time)

## Week Two and Three
During weeks two and three, project groups meet together to work on the projects. Neuromatched Mentors will
visit the groups to discuss the projects and provide advice. Remember, this is about the experience, not producing a
publication-worthy project! All groups must finish their projects by the end of project day 13 (W3D3).

 * **Project day 14** — Prepare project presentation
 * Groups make a 10 minute project presentation and a recording for a virtual ‘poster session’
 * All group members should contribute to the presenation slides and video!

 * **NMA final day** — Presentation of projects

  * The afternoon of the final day of NMA will include project presentations!

# Student Guide to NMA Projects

in small groups to develop a scientific question, select a data set to analyze and work together to develop a project
that you will present at the end of NMA. You will be able to see an overview of the curriculum topics to help you
brainstorm and we have prepared data sets for your projects. During your project time, you will be meeting with your
teaching assistant and mentors, who will be neuromatched to your projects at the end of week one! You
should try to :

 1. How do you develop a clear scientific question?
 2. What are the limits of a particular dataset?
 3. How do you select techniques or tools to answer your scientific question given the available data?
 4. Is the scope of the project something you can complete in two weeks—generate a question generation, analyze data, make a presentation of the findings

## **Time commitment**

We have assigned about four hours per day for your projects. However, we know that you will also be doing a lot of work
on the curriculum and we want to make sure you balance your project effort with keeping up with the whole NMA. Make
sure that you discuss how much effort you think you can manage with the others in your project group. It’s ok if some
people want to do more or less, if you agree on a goal that allows everyone to participate as much as they want. But
you must seriously consider the amount of work you are planning to do for your project with the amount of effort your
group feels it can handle. Remember, it is better to do less but do it well, than try to do more but not be able to
complete the work in the time you have. Finally, if you feel that participating in the Projects is going to take too
much time and prevent you from engaging deeply with the curiculum material, you can opt to not join a project group on
project day 5. But, we hope you will join a project group—projects are a fun way to build your skills, get to know people
and to play with interesting data!

You will have support from your teaching assistant (primarily for code and technical questions) and your mentors, but
only for a limited amount of time. Try to organize your questions and have a good discussion with them when they are
available so you can use your own time to make progress! More importantly, your NMA fellow students are an amazing
resource! Use Neurostars to ask questions and answer questions from fellow students!

# TA Guide to NMA Projects

The Neuromatch Academy projects are small group projects that will help the students build the skill of taking a
question and trying to apply concepts or tools from the NMA curriculum. Teaching assistants are a critical component of
this process and you will be providing guidance and support for these projects.

A few important things to remember:
 * The exact question and data set is not important, we are interested in the process
 * The ‘quality’, ‘novelty’ and ‘depth’ of the question and outcome are less important than completing the full cycle
 * You will help guide the students during week one to help them form project groups
 * During weeks two and three you only need to provide office hours for the groups (30 minutes per group)
  * Remind students about project schedule to keep them on track
  * Promote course materials and toolkits provided by the NMA
  * Advise students about how to make a good presentation
 * If you want to make time availible for answer questions outside of this time, we appreciate it, but it is not required!

*These are **student-run** projects. TAs are only facilitators, and you are not responsible for the content of the projects.*

# Mentor Guide to NMA Projects

As a Mentor, you will have two roles:

* **Week one** — Brainstorming and project idea refinement
    * You will be matched to a Pod (larger group of students) and will not be matched based on area of research
    * Help the students refine the ideas they have brainstormed into clear projects with goals
    * Help the students select tools, models or appraches to answer their question
      * The exact question and data set is not important, we are interested in the process

* **Week two and three** — Guiding projects to completion
    * You will be matched to project groups based on your area of expertise
    * Help the students pursue their projects
    * Suggest ways to move the projects forward if the students are stuck
    * Provide space for discusion of the project ideas
    * The ‘quality’, ‘novelty’ and ‘depth’ of the question and outcome are less important than completing the full cycle

## AirTable match information

 * You will receive an email with 'match' information from NMA for week one and then again for week two and three.
 * You will have contact information (Links for video, emal and names in an 'AirTable')
 * If you thin you have any quesrtons, please contact us!
