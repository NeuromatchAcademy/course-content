# Introduction to projects

*July 5-23, 2021*

----

# **Project Structure**

The definitive guide to project schedule and structure is in the [Daily Guide to Projects](./docs/project_guidance.md), but we include some overview information here.

The NMA projects are conducted over 14 days, beginning on the first project timeslot after the school opening on July 5.
The projects are a core part of the summer school, and will teach different skills from those you learn during the course work.

Your pod will split into two groups at the end of the first day, based on common research interests.
Day 2 is a full project day to kickstart your projects: you begin with structured material during normal tutorial time (2-3h), and
continue with structured project time to try to formulate a project proposal by the end of the day (submit [here](https://airtable.com/shrZWimDB3YddpXDu)).
You will be matched to external mentors based on this proposal, so please include as many relevant keywords as possible.

During the second week, you will continue through the process of refining your question and
finding the right data analyses to test your hypotheses, culminating in an "abstract" that you write on day 10, which is
again a full projects day with some structured guidance to the process of writing abstracts.

Finally, week 3 is all about implementing your project and trying to get an answer to your question, culminating in a short presentation to your pod
on the final day 15 (5 minutes, 3-5 slides, informal, take turns to present).


# **Daily Schedule**

Daily project time is either:
 - Early — 3h before content (time slots 2,4)
 - Late  — 3h after content (time slots 1,3,5)

 For those of you whose project slot is before tutorials (slots 2,4), there is no project time on the first day of the course - you simply show up to tutorials that day. For those of you whose project slot is after tutorials (slots 1,3,5), there is no project time on the last day of the course - there is a wrap up project presentation session during the tutorial block that day and then the course ends. Your project proposals (used for mentor matching) are due at the end of the project block 2 - this is either:

 - July 6, any time for Slots 1,3,5
 - July 7, right after the projects time for Slots 2,4 (but before you start coursework on this day)

 Here is a table summary of the schedule:

| date | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Slot 4 | Slot 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| July 5 | project block 1 | empty | project block 1 | empty | project block 1 |
| July 6 | project block 2 | project block 1 | project block 2 | project block 1 | project block 2 |
| July 7 | ... | project block 2 | ... | project block 2 | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| July 16 | abstract day | abstract day | abstract day | abstract day | abstract day |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| July 22 | project block 14 | ... | project block 14 | ... | project block 14 |
| July 23 | empty | project block 14 | empty | project block 14 | empty |

On July 23, everyone has project presentations during the second half of their tutorial block!
