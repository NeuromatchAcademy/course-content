# Guide to choosing a Theory project

*July 5-23, 2021*

Pure theory projects are usually pursued by more advanced students. If your group is relatively new to neuroscience, you should consider doing a dataset project *and* include a theory component to it.

Every group can bring up and discuss theory projects. We have two example project templates for this that include code. However, a theory project can go in any direction.

## Databases of models
​
Here is a list of cool databases you might want to use to look for existing models, computational analyses / data processing tools and data. 
​
| Name                                                  | Model? | Analyses? | Data? | Description                                                  |
