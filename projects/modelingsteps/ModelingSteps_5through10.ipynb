There are some extra considerations when publishing a model. In general, you should explain each of the steps in the paper:\n",

In this way your models can impact future experiments, and future data can then be modeled (see modeling process schematic below). Remember your audience - it is _always_ hard to clearly convey the main points of your work to others, especially if your audience doesn't necessarily create computational models themselves.\n",

This forces focussing on the main points: describing the relevance, question, model, answer and what it all means very succinctly. This allows you to decide to do this project or not **before you commit time writing code for no good purpose**. Notice that this is really what we've walked you through carefully in this guide! 😀\n"
