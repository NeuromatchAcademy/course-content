    "* **What is the phenomena**? Here summarize the part of the phenomena which your modeling addresses.\n",
    "* **What is the key scientific question?**: Clearly articulate the question which your modeling tries to answer.\n",

    "* **How did your modeling work?** Give an overview of the model, it's main components, and how the modeling works. ''Here we ... ''\n",
    "* **What did you find? Did the modeling work?** Explain the key outcomes of your modeling evaluation.\n",
    "* **What can you conclude?** Conclude as much as you can _with reference to the hypothesis_, within the limits of the modeling.  \n",
    "* **What are the limitations and future directions?** What is left to be learned? Briefly argue the plausibility of the approach and/or what you think is essential that may have been left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**: write down your answer to each of those questions (1-2 sentences each, max!). When you're done, stick the sentences together... Now you have an abstract!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidance for paper writing\n",
    "There are good guidelines for structuring and writing an effective paper (e.g., [Mensh & Kording, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)), all of which apply to papers about models. There are some extra considerations when publishing a model. In general, you should explain each of the steps in the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:** Steps 1 & 2 (maybe 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:** Steps 3-7, 9\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** Steps 8 & 9, going back to 1, 2 & 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some great materials to help you with paper writing:\n",
    "* [Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833)\n",
    "* [How to Write Strong and Effective Figure Legends](https://wordvice.com/how-to-write-effective-figure-titles-and-legends/)\n",
    "* [How to Create a Consistent Writing Schedule: 10 Tips for Writers](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-create-a-consistent-writing-schedule)\n",
    "\n",
    "The audience for all of this should be experimentalists, as they are the ones who can test predictions made by your model and collect new data. In this way your models can impact future experiments, and future data can then be modeled (see modeling process schematic below). Remember your audience - it is _always_ hard to clearly convey the main points of your work to others, especially if your audience doesn't necessarily create computational models themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you should provide a visualization of the model, and upload the code implementing the model and the data it was trained and tested on to a repository (e.g., GitHub, OSF).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestion\n",
    "\n",
    "For every modeling project, a very good exercise is to _**first**_ write a short, 100-word abstract of the project plan and expected impact. This forces focussing on the main points: describing the relevance, question, model, answer and what it all means very succinctly. This allows you to decide to do this project or not **before you commit time writing code for no good purpose**. Notice that this is really what we've walked you through carefully in this guide! 😀"
