Of course, this only works if we record activity from neuronal populations that contribute to self-motion judgements. On the other hand, we would also see this result if the sensory signal was not noisy and we recorded from one of several populations that contribute to self-motion judgements in a noisy way.

Vestibular information can disambiguate self motion from motion of the adjacent train. (B) However, it is unknown if accumulated, noisy vestibular neuron activity correlates with self-motion judgement. (C) Based on previous modeling efforts, we hypothesized that cumulative spike counts (not instantaneous) recorded from vestibular neurons can better discriminate experienced self motion judgements as opposed to true self motion.

This was done both with the vestibular signal accumulated across the full trial and with a 100 ms window ('instantaneous') around peak acceleration, and with 2 different speeds compared to a no-motion condition.
