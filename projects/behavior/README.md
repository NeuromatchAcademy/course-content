# Guide to choosing a Behavior dataset

*July 5-23, 2021*

Everyone should consider the behavior-only datasets that we have, which are very rich with many subjects and many trials.

## Caltech

The Caltech dataset ([youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tDmhmasjPeM)) has pose-tracking data from socially-interacting mice, and is well supported with code and a project template.

## IBL

The IBL dataset ([youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NofrFH8FRZU)) is a visual decision-making task, that is very similar to the one used in the Steinmetz dataset.

## Laquitaine & Gardner, Neuron, 2017

The Laquitaine & Gardner dataset contains behavioral data collected in a motion direction estimation task performed by 12 human subjects. The data include motion direction estimates, reaction times and various task variables recorded for 83,214 trials. The authors varied the strength of sensory evidence (motion coherence) and priors (set of directions) and compared the trial-estimate distribution with the predictions of Bayesian observer models.
