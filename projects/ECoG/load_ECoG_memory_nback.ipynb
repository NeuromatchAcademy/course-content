Exp1 is a \"0-back\" memory experiment, where the subjects have to identify the picture of one of the houses (stimid = 10), which they have memorized at the beginning of the stimulus block. Exp2 is a 1-back memory experiment, where the participants have to respond to images of repeated houses. Finally, exp3 is 2-back where participants respond to pictures of houses that are repeated after another intervening random picture. This task was hard for these participants and most of them did not really respond at all, but the data can still be used to ask questions about overall shifts of neural activity in a hard task when the subjects feel overwhelmed by the memory requirements.\n",
