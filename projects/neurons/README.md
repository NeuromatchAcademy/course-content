# Guide to choosing a Neurons dataset

*July 5-23, 2021*

* The **Steinmetz** dataset was used by the most groups last year, as it is great for exploratory analyses and is relatively well supported with code and many included experimental and behavioral variables.

* The **Stringer** datasets are a little more advanced, as there are 10,000-20,000 neurons recorded simultaneously to deal with, and there is no explicit task the animals are doing. They are exciting, because they give a taste of what's to come in neuroscience.

* The **Allen Institute** dataset is new this year, and it was designed to be very friendly for beginners. The mice do a well defined task, and the recordings are from specific neuron populations in multiple visual cortical brain areas. It is also well supported with code and the dedicated project template. This would provide a more focused experience for beginner groups than the Steinmetz dataset, with the caveat that the data is unpublished so it is harder to find supporting information for it.
