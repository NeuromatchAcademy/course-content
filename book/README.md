# Jupyterbook Support

We use [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) to create a condensed,
single interface to all our course materials. This book will be autogenerated
and published to [https://neuromatchacademy.github.io/course-content] every time
a PR is merged into the master branch.

The Github workflow is defined in .github/workflows/publish-book.yml. 

In order to build the book locally, you will need to do the following:

1. Install dependencies 

`pip install jupyter-book==0.10.2`

Do not install jupyter-book 0.11 or later at this point, as there are breaking
changes in how it handles the table of contents file we generate.

2. Create a symlink in the book dir to the tutorials dir. From the repo root
directory:
   
`ln -s ../tutorials book/tutorials`

`ln -s ../projects book/projects`

3. Prepare repo for book building

`python ci/generate_book.py`

This will use the tutorials/materials.yml to create the _toc.yml file in the
book directory. It will also be responsible for creating any additional markdown
files or modifying any tutorial notebooks specifically for book generation. 

**No changes created by this script should be committed to the repo.**

4. Build the book

`jupyer-book build book`
