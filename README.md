# NeuroMatch Academy (NMA) Computational Neuroscience syllabus

**The content should primarily be accessed from our new ebook: https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/**

**Objectives**: Introduce traditional and emerging computational neuroscience tools, their complementarity, and what they can tell us about the brain. A main focus is on modeling choices, model creation, model evaluation and understanding how they relate to biological questions.

**Prerequisites**: [See here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse)

|    0:45-2:15     |    Tutorials + nano-lectures I        |    
|    2:15-3:15     |    Big break                 |

\* The intro and outro will be watched asynchronously, which means that you can watch this lecture before and after the start of the synchronous session

\** Note that the synchronous session starts at 0:30 with the first pod discussion!

On W2D1, W2D4, and W3D4:
|    Time (Hour)   |    Lecture                            | 
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
|    5:40-6:40     |    Live Q&A                                |   


On W1D2 (project launch day):

|    Time (Hour)   |    Lecture                            |

\*** Note that this includes the next available project time, which may be on the next day.

On W2D5 (abstract writing day):
