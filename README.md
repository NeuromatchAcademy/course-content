# NeuroMatch Academy (NMA) Computational Neuroscience syllabus

**The content should primarily be accessed from our new ebook: https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/**

**Objectives**: Introduce traditional and emerging computational neuroscience tools, their complementarity, and what they can tell us about the brain. A main focus is on modeling choices, model creation, model evaluation and understanding how they relate to biological questions.

**Prerequisites**: [See here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse)

## Daily coursework schedule

### General schedule
All days (except W2D1, W2D5, and W3D5) will follow this schedule for course time:
 
|    Time (Hour)   |    Lecture                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
|   -0:30-0:00\*   |    Intro video & text                 |
|    0:00-0:15\**  |    Pod Discussion I                   |
|    0:15-1:45     |    Tutorials I                        |
|    1:45-2:45     |    Big break                          |
|    2:45-4:15     |    Tutorials II                       |
|    4:15-4:25     |    Pod Discussion II                  |
|    4:25-4:30     |    Reflections & content checks       |

\* : The intro and outro will be watched asynchronously, which means that you can watch this lecture before and after the start of the synchronous session

\** : Note that the synchronous session starts at 0:00 with the first pod discussion!

### Schedule of Specific Days

#### W2D1: Modeling Practice & Half project day (project proposals)

|    Time (Hour)   |    Lecture                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
|    0:00-0:30\*   |    Intro video & text                 |
|    0:30-2:30\**  |    Tutorials I                        |
|    2:30-2:45     |    Outro                              |
