# NeuroMatch Academy (NMA) syllabus

*July 13-31, 2020*

**Objectives**: Introduce traditional and emerging computational neuroscience tools, their complementarity, and what they can tell us about the brain. A main focus is on modeling choices, model creation, model evaluation and understanding how they relate to biological questions.

**Tutorial microstructure**: ~10min talk, ~20min tutorial (repeated)

**Day structure**: Opening keynote, 3h lecture/tutorial modules, 1h interpretation (what did we learn today, what does it mean, underlying philosophy, 1h professional development/ meta-science, evening group projects (for interactive track). There will also be many networking activities!

**Prerequisites**: [See here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse)

## Week 1

### Mon, July 13: Model Types

**Description** Introduce different example model types (Marr 1-3, what/how/why) and the kinds of questions they can answer. Realize how different models map onto different datasets.
