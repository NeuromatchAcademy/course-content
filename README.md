# NeuroMatch Academy (NMA) Computational Neuroscience syllabus

| :warning: This repository is under construction for the 2021 edition of the course :warning:
| :---: |
| See the [NMA website](https://academy.neuromatch.io/nma2020/course-materials) for links to archival materials from the 2020 edition |

**Objectives**: Introduce traditional and emerging computational neuroscience tools, their complementarity, and what they can tell us about the brain. A main focus is on modeling choices, model creation, model evaluation and understanding how they relate to biological questions.

**Day structure**: Opening keynote, 3h15min lecture/live Q&A/tutorial modules, 40min group discussion, 55min interpretation lecture (Outro) + several live Q&As (what did we learn today, what does it mean, underlying philosophy). There will also be many networking activities (professional development sessions, yoga, social hangouts etc)! Details below.

**Note for visitors from China**: This repository contains many links to YouTube and Google Colab. We have a version of the repository with those same videos posted on bilibili, and the Google Colab links replaced with links to Aliyun.
