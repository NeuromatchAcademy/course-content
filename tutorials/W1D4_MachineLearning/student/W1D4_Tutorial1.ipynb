First with a Linear-Gaussian GLM (also known as ordinary least-squares regression model) and then with a Poisson GLM (aka \"Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson\" model). In the next tutorial, weâ€™ll extend to a special case of GLMs, logistic regression, and learn how to ensure good model performance.\n",

    "### Exercise 1: Create design matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to predict the cell's activity from the stimulus intensities preceding it. That will help us understand how RGCs process information over time. To do so, we first need to create the *design matrix* for this model, which organizes the stimulus intensities in matrix form such that the $i$th row has the stimulus frames preceding timepoint $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will create the design matrix $X$ using $d=25$ time lags. That is, $X$ should be a $T \\times d$ matrix. $d = 25$ (about 200 ms) is a choice we're making based on our prior knowledge of the temporal window that influences RGC responses. In practice, you might not know the right duration to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last entry in row `t` should correspond to the stimulus that was shown at time `t`, the entry to the left of it should contain the value that was show one time bin earlier, etc. Specifically, $X_{ij}$ will be the stimulus intensity at time $i + d - 1 - j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the first few time bins, we have access to the recorded spike counts but not to the stimulus shown in the recent past. For simplicity we are going to assume that values of `stim` are 0 for the time lags prior to the first timepoint in the dataset. This is known as \"zero-padding\", so that the design matrix has the same number of rows as the response vectors in `spikes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is is to complete the function below to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - make a zero-padded version of the stimulus\n",
    "  - initialize an empty design matrix with the correct shape\n",
    "  - **fill in each row of the design matrix, using the zero-padded version of the stimulus**\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize your design matrix (and the corresponding vector of spike counts), we will plot a \"heatmap\", which encodes the numerical value in each position of the matrix as a color. The helper functions include some code to do this."

We learned how to construct a design matrix that we could pass to different GLMs, and we found that the Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model allowed us to predict spike rates better than a simple Linear-Gaussian (LG) model.\n",
