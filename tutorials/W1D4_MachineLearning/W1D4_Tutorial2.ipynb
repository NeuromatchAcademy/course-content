We applied the algorithm to a *neural decoding* problem: we tried to predict an animal's behavioral choice from its neural activity. We saw again how important it is to use *cross-validation* to evaluate complex models that are at risk for *overfitting*, and we learned how *regularization* can be used to fit models that generalize better. Finally, we learned about some of the different options for regularization, and we saw how cross-validation can be useful for *model selection*."
