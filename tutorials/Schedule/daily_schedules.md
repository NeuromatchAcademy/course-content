## Daily coursework schedule

### General schedule
All days (except W2D1, W2D5, and W3D5) will follow this schedule for course time:
 
|    Time (Hour)   |    Lecture                            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|

|    0:15-1:45     |    Tutorials I                        |
|    1:45-2:45     |    Big break                          |
|    2:45-4:15     |    Tutorials II                       |

|    4:25-4:30     |    Reflections & content checks       |

\* : The intro and outro will be watched asynchronously, which means that you can watch this lecture before and after the start of the synchronous session

\** : Note that the synchronous session starts at 0:00 with the first pod discussion!

### Schedule of Specific Days
