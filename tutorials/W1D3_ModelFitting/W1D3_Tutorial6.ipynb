We will use bootstrapping to build confidence intervals around the inferred linear model parameters (Tutorial 3). We'll finish our exploration of regression models by generalizing to multiple linear regression and polynomial regression (Tutorial 4). We end by learning how to choose between these various models. We discuss the bias-variance trade-off (Tutorial 5) and Cross Validation for model selection (Tutorial 6).\n",

    "We now have multiple choices for which model to use for a given problem: we could use linear regression, order 2 polynomial regression, order 3 polynomial regression, etc. As we saw in Tutorial 5, different models will have different quality of predictions, both on the training data and on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used method for model selection is to asks how well the model predicts new data that it hasn't seen yet. But we don't want to use test data to do this, otherwise that would mean using it during the training process! One approach is to use another kind of held-out data which we call **validation data**: we do not fit the model with this data but we use it to select our best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often have a limited amount of data though (especially in neuroscience), so we do not want to further reduce our potential training data by reassigning some as validation. Luckily, we can use **k-fold cross-validation**! In k-fold cross validation, we divide up the training data into k subsets (that are called *folds*, see diagram below), train our model on the first k-1 folds, and then compute error on the last held-out fold. We can then repeat this process k times, once on each k-1 folds of the data. Each of these k instances (which are called *splits*, see diagram below) excludes a different fold from fitting. We then average the error of each of the k trained models on its held-out subset - this is the final measure of performance which we can use to do model selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this explicit, let's say we have 1000 samples of training data and choose 4-fold cross-validation. Samples 0 - 250 would be subset 1, samples 250 - 500 subset 2, samples 500 - 750 subset 3, and samples 750-1000 subset 4. First, we train an order 3 polynomial regression on subsets 1, 2, 3 and evaluate on subset 4. Next, we train an order 3 polynomial model on subsets 1, 2, 4 and evalute on subset 3. We continue until we have 4 instances of a trained order 3 polynomial regression model, each with a different subset as held-out data, and average the held-out error from each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now compare the error of different models to pick a model that generalizes well to held-out data. We can choose the measure of prediction quality to report error on the held-out subsets to suit our purposes. We will use MSE here but we could also use log likelihood of the data and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final step, it is common to retrain this model on all of the training data (without subset divisions) to get our final model that we will evaluate on test data. This approach allows us to evaluate the quality of predictions on new data without sacrificing any of our precious training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the held-out subsets are called either validation or test subsets. There is not a consensus and may depend on the exact use of k-fold cross validation. Sometimes people use k-fold cross validation to choose between different models/parameters to then apply to held-out test data and sometimes people report the averaged error on the held-out subsets as the model performance.   If you are doing the former (using k-fold cross validation for model selection), you must report performance on held-out test data! In this text/code, we will refer to them as validation subsets to differentiate from our completely held-out test data (differing from the video above).\n"

A lot of false-positives in cross-validation come from wrongly dividing. \n",

If we just fit using MSE on training data, we will generally find that fits get better as we add more parameters because the model will overfit the data, as we saw in Tutorial 5.
