    "This is Tutorial 4 of a series on fitting models to data. We start with simple linear regression, using least squares optimization (Tutorial 1) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Tutorial 2). We will use bootstrapping to build confidence intervals around the inferred linear model parameters (Tutorial 3). We'll finish our exploration of regression models by generalizing to multiple linear regression and polynomial regression (Tutorial 4). We end by learning how to choose between these various models. We discuss the bias-variance trade-off (Tutorial 5) and Cross Validation for model selection (Tutorial 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will generalize the regression model to incorporate multiple features.\n",
    "- Learn how to structure inputs for regression using the 'Design Matrix'\n",
    "- Generalize the MSE for multiple features using the ordinary least squares estimator\n",
    "- Visualize data and model fit in multiple dimensions\n",
    "- Fit polynomial regression models of different complexity\n",

Put another way, the predicted outputs are only a weighted sum of the inputs. What if there are more complicated computations happening? Luckily, many more complex models exist (and you will encounter many more over the next 3 weeks). One model that is still very simple to fit and understand, but captures more complex relationships, is **polynomial regression**, an extension of linear regression.\n",
