    "This is Tutorial 4 of a series on fitting models to data. We start with simple linear regression, using least squares optimization (Tutorial 1) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Tutorial 2). We will use bootstrapping to build confidence intervals around the inferred linear model parameters (Tutorial 3). We'll finish our exploration of regression models by generalizing to multiple linear regression and polynomial regression (Tutorial 4). We end by learning how to choose between these various models. We discuss the bias-variance trade-off (Tutorial 5) and Cross Validation for model selection (Tutorial 6).\n",

    "- Generalize the MSE for multiple features using the ordinary least squares estimator\n",
    "- Visualize data and model fit in multiple dimensions\n",
    "- Fit polynomial regression models of different complexity\n",

    "One potential problem with this approach is the simplicity of the model. Linear regression, as the name implies, can only capture a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. Put another way, the predicted outputs are only a weighted sum of the inputs. What if there are more complicated computations happening? Luckily, many more complex models exist (and you will encounter many more over the next 3 weeks). One model that is still very simple to fit and understand, but captures more complex relationships, is **polynomial regression**, an extension of linear regression.\n",

    "Let's go back to one feature for each data point. For linear regression, we used $\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{x}$ as the input data, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is a vector where each element is the input for a single data point. To add a constant bias (a y-intercept in a 2-D plot), we use $\\mathbf{X} = \\big[ \\boldsymbol 1, \\mathbf{x} \\big]$, where $\\boldsymbol 1$ is a column of ones.  When fitting, we learn a weight for each column of this matrix. So we learn a weight that multiples with column 1 - in this case that column is all ones so we gain the bias parameter ($+ \\theta_0$). \n",
