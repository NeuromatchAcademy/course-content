    "*Estimated timing of tutorial: 1 hour, 15 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part 1 of a 2-part series about Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), which are a fundamental framework for supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, the objective is to model a retinal ganglion cell spike train by fitting a temporal receptive field. First with a Linear-Gaussian GLM (also known as ordinary least-squares regression model) and then with a Poisson GLM (aka \"Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson\" model). In the next tutorial, we’ll extend to a special case of GLMs, logistic regression, and learn how to ensure good model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to run with retinal ganglion cell spike train data from [Uzzell & Chichilnisky 2004](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.01171.2003?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed).\n",

    "### Coding Exercise 1.1: Create design matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to predict the cell's activity from the stimulus intensities preceding it. That will help us understand how RGCs process information over time. To do so, we first need to create the *design matrix* for this model, which organizes the stimulus intensities in matrix form such that the $i$th row has the stimulus frames preceding timepoint $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will create the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ using $d=25$ time lags. That is, $\\mathbf{X}$ should be a $T \\times d$ matrix. $d = 25$ (about 200 ms) is a choice we're making based on our prior knowledge of the temporal window that influences RGC responses. In practice, you might not know the right duration to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last entry in row `t` should correspond to the stimulus that was shown at time `t`, the entry to the left of it should contain the value that was show one time bin earlier, etc. Specifically, $X_{ij}$ will be the stimulus intensity at time $i + d - 1 - j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the first few time bins, we have access to the recorded spike counts but not to the stimulus shown in the recent past. For simplicity we are going to assume that values of `stim` are 0 for the time lags prior to the first timepoint in the dataset. This is known as \"zero-padding\", so that the design matrix has the same number of rows as the response vectors in `spikes`.\n",
