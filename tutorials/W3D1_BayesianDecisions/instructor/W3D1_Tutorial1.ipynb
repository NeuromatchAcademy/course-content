    "\n",
    "This is the first of two core tutorials on Bayesian statistics. In these tutorials, we will explore the fundamental concepts of the Bayesian approach. In this tutorial you will work through an example of Bayesian inference and decision making using a binary hidden state. The second tutorial extends these concepts to a continuous hidden state. In the related NMA days, each of these basic ideas will be extended. In Hidden Dynamics, we consider these ideas through time as you explore what happens when we infer a hidden state using repeated observations and when the hidden state changes across time. On the Optimal Control day, we will introduce the notion of how to use inference and decisions to select actions for optimal control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce the fundamental building blocks for Bayesian statistics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we combine the possible loss (or gain) for making a decision with our probabilistic knowledge?\n",
    "2. How do we use probability distributions to represent hidden states?\n",
    "3. How does marginalization work and how can we use it?\n",
    "4. How do we combine new information with our prior knowledge? "

We define our knowledge about the fish location as a distribution over the random hidden state variable. Using our probabilistic knowledge, also called our **belief** about the hidden state, we will explore how to make the decision about where to fish today, based on what to expect in terms of gains or losses for the decision.\n",

    "You need to decide where to fish. It may seem obvious - you could just fish on the side where the probability of the fish being is higher! Unfortunately, decisions and actions are always a little more complicated. Deciding to fish may be influenced by more than just the probability of the school of fish being there as we saw by the potential issues of submarines and sunburn. The consequences of the action you take is based on the true (but hidden) state of the world and the action you choose! In our example, fishing on the wrong side, where there aren't many fish, is likely to lead to you spending your afternoon not catching fish and therefore getting a sunburn. The submarine represents a risk to fishing on the right side that is greater than the left side. If you want to know what to expect from taking the action of fishing on one side or the other, you need to calculate the expected utility.\n",

You can change the probability that the school of fish is on the left side,$p(s = \\textrm{left})$, using the slider. You will see the utility function (a matrix) in the middle and the corresponding expected utility for each action on the right.\n",

In the initial state: the probability of the fish being on the left is 0.9 and on the right is 0.1. The expected utility of the action of fishing on the left is then $U(s = \\textrm{left},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{left}) + U(s = \\textrm{right},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{right}) = 2(0.9) + -2(0.1) = 1.6$.

    "We will think of this in two different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first math exercise, you will think about the case where you know the joint probabilities of two variables and want to figure out the probability of just one variable. To make this explicit, let's assume that a fish has a color that is either gold or silver (our first variable) and a size that is either small or large (our second). We could write out the the **joint probabilities**: the probability of both specific attributes occuring together. For example, the probability of a fish being small and silver, $P(X = \\textrm{small}, Y = \\textrm{silver})$, is 0.4. The following table summarizes our joint probabilities:\n",

    "| X = large      | 0.1         | 0.3       |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know what the probability of a fish being small  regardless of color. Since the fish are either silver or gold, this would be the probability of a fish being small and silver plus the probability of a fish being small and gold. This is an example of marginalizing, or averaging out, the variable we are not interested in across the rows or columns.. In math speak: $P(X = \\textrm{small}) = \\sum_y{P(X = \\textrm{small}, Y)}$. This gives us a **marginal probability**, a probability of a variable outcome (in this case size), regardless of the other variables (in this case color).\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can marginalize out a second irrelevant variable $y$ by summing over the relevant joint probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x) = \\sum_y p(x, y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second math exercise, you will remove an unknown (the hidden state) to find the marginal probability of a measurement. You will do this by marginalizing out the hidden state. In this case, you know the conditional probabilities of the measurement given state and the probabilities of each state. You can marginalize using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(m) = \\sum_s p(m | s) p(s) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These two ways of thinking about marginalization (as averaging over joint probabilities or conditioning on some variable) are equivalent because the joint probability of two variables equals the conditional probability of the first given the second times the marginal probability of the second:\n",

Better yet, we sometimes don't need to bother with this normalization! The normalization term, $P(m)$, is the probability of the measurement. This does not depend on state so is essentially a constant we can often ignore. We can compare the unnormalized posterior distribution values for different states because how they relate to each other is unchanged when divided by the same constant.
