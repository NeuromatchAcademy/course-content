There are a number of different logical positions in which treatments of Bayesian statistics started
that are relevant to NMA.

### Statistics:

Beautiful combination of Bayesian statistics with information theory by the late David MacKay. the book is available for free online. Simply beautiful:
MacKay, David JC, and David JC Mac Kay. Information theory, inference and learning
algorithms. Cambridge university press, 2003.  

Still the standard book. Not exactly perfect for beginners but beautiful:
Gelman, Andrew, et al. Bayesian data analysis . CRC press, 2013. 


A great text book full of intuitive illustration:
McElreath, Richard. Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan, CRC press, 2020. 
This book also comes with youtube video/lectures that cover every chapter of the book https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WVelCswXo4&list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI 
One of the best resources out there to get started on Bayesian stuff.

This book is good for the python Bayes codes:
Downey, Allen. Think Bayes: Bayesian statistics in python . " O'Reilly Media, Inc.", 2013. 

Another introductory book:
Kruschke, John. Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan, Academic Press, 2014.


### Normative Models:

The book that propelled the field to visibility:
Knill, David C., and Whitman Richards, eds. Perception as Bayesian inference . Cambridge
University Press, 1996.

This book is largely focused on Bayesian approaches to cue combination:
Trommershauser, Julia, Konrad Kording, and Michael S. Landy, eds. Sensory cue integration .
Oxford University Press, 2011

### Analysis of neural data:

This book contains a good treatment of Bayesian approaches to the analysis of neural data:
Kass, Robert E., Uri T. Eden, and Emery N. Brown. Analysis of neural data . Vol. 491. New York:
Springer, 2014.
