There are a number of different logical positions in which treatments of Bayesian statistics started that are relevant to NMA.

### Statistics:

MacKay, D. J. C. (2003). Information theory, inference and learning algorithms. Cambridge university press. url: [inference.org.uk/itprnn](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf)
 - Beautiful combination of Bayesian statistics with information theory by the late David MacKay. The book is available for free online. Simply beautiful

Gelman, A., Carlin, J. B., Stern, H. S., & Rubin, D. B. (1995). Bayesian data analysis. Chapman and Hall/CRC.
 - Still the standard book. Not exactly perfect for beginners but beautiful

McElreath, R. (2020). Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan. Chapman and Hall/CRC.
 - A great text book full of intuitive illustration
 - This book also comes with youtube video/lectures that cover every chapter of the book: [youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WVelCswXo4&list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI)
 - One of the best resources out there to get started on Bayesian stuff.

Downey, A. (2013). Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics in Python. O'Reilly Media, Inc.
 - This book is good for the python Bayes codes

Kruschke, J. (2014). Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan. Academic Press.
 - This book is good for the python Bayes codes

### Normative Models:

Knill, D. C., and Richards, W. (Eds.). (1996). Perception as Bayesian inference. Cambridge University Press.
 - The book that propelled the field to visibility: 

Welchman, A. E., Trommershauser, J., Kording, K., and Landy, M. S. (2011). Decoding the cortical representation of depth. Sensory cue integration. Oxford University Press.
 - This book is largely focused on Bayesian approaches to cue combination

### Analysis of neural data:

Kass, R. E., Eden, U. T., & Brown, E. N. (2014). Analysis of neural data (Vol. 491). New York: Springer.
 - This book contains a good treatment of Bayesian approaches to the analysis of neural data
