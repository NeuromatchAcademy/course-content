    "This is the first of two core tutorials on Bayesian statistics. In these tutorials, we will explore the fundamental concepts of the Bayesian approach. In this tutorial you will work through an example of Bayesian inference and decision making using a binary hidden state. The second tutorial extends these concepts to a continuous hidden state. In the related NMA days, each of these basic ideas will be extended. In Hidden Dynamics, we consider these ideas through time as you explore what happens when we infer a hidden state using repeated observations and when the hidden state changes across time. On the Optimal Control day, we will introduce the notion of how to use inference and decisions to select actions for optimal control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce the fundamental building blocks for Bayesian statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we combine the possible loss (or gain) for making a decision with our probabilistic knowledge?\n",
    "2. How do we use probability distributions to represent hidden states?\n",
    "3. How does marginalization work and how can we use it?\n",
    "4. How do we combine new information with our prior knowledge?"

On different days the school of fish is either on the left or right side, but we don’t know what the case is today. We define our knowledge about the fish location as a distribution over the random hidden state variable. Using our probabilistic knowledge, also called our **belief** about the hidden state, we will explore how to make the decision about where to fish today, based on what to expect in terms of gains or losses for the decision.\n",

    "You need to decide where to fish. It may seem obvious - you could just fish on the side where the probability of the fish being is higher! Unfortunately, decisions and actions are always a little more complicated. Deciding to fish may be influenced by more than just the probability of the school of fish being there as we saw by the potential issues of submarines and sunburn. The consequences of the action you take is based on the true (but hidden) state of the world and the action you choose! In our example, fishing on the wrong side, where there aren't many fish, is likely to lead to you spending your afternoon not catching fish and therefore getting a sunburn. The submarine represents a risk to fishing on the right side that is greater than the left side. If you want to know what to expect from taking the action of fishing on one side or the other, you need to calculate the expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know the (prior) probability that the school of fish is on the left side of the dock today, $P(s = \\textrm{left})$. So, you also know the probability the school is on the right, $P(s = \\textrm{right})$, because these two probabilities must add up to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We quantify gains and losses numerically using a **utility** function $U(s,a)$, which describes the consequences of your actions: how much value you gain (or if negative, lose) given the state of the world ($s$) and the action you take ($a$). In our example, our utility can be summarized as:\n",

You can change the probability that the school of fish is on the left side,$p(s = \\textrm{left})$, using the slider. You will see the utility function (a matrix) in the middle and the corresponding expected utility for each action on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you understand how the expected utility of each action is being computed from the probabilities and the utility values. In the initial state: the probability of the fish being on the left is 0.9 and on the right is 0.1. The expected utility of the action of fishing on the left is then $U(s = \\textrm{left},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{left}) + U(s = \\textrm{right},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{right}) = 2(0.9) + -2(0.1) = 1.6$. Essentially, to get the expected utility of action $a$, you are doing a weighted sum over the relevant column of the utility matrix (corresponding to action $a$) where the weights are the state probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these scenarios, think and discuss first. Then use the demo to try out each and see if your action would have been correct (that is, if the expected value of that action is the highest).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You just arrived at the dock for the first time and have no sense of where the fish might be. So you guess that the probability of the school being on the left side is 0.5 (so the probability on the right side is also 0.5). Which side would you choose to fish on given our utility values?\n",
    "2.  You think that the probability of the school being on the left side is very low (0.1) and correspondingly high on the right side (0.9). Which side would you choose to fish on given our utility values?\n",
    "3.  What would you choose if the probability of the school being on the left side is slightly lower than on the right side (0. 4 vs 0.6)?"

To make this explicit, let's assume that a fish has a color that is either gold or silver (our first variable) and a size that is either small or large (our second). We could write out the the **joint probabilities**: the probability of both specific attributes occuring together. For example, the probability of a fish being small and silver, $P(X = \\textrm{small}, Y = \\textrm{silver})$, is 0.4. The following table summarizes our joint probabilities:\n",

This gives us a **marginal probability**, a probability of a variable outcome (in this case size), regardless of the other variables (in this case color).\n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically, we covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* That the likelihood is the probability of the measurement given some hidden state\n",
    "\n",
    "* That how the prior and likelihood interact to create the posterior, the probability of the hidden state given a measurement, depends on how they covary\n",
    "\n",
    "* That utility is the gain from each action and state pair, and the expected utility for an action is the sum of the utility for all state pairs, weighted by the probability of that state happening. You can then choose the action with the highest expected utility.\n"
