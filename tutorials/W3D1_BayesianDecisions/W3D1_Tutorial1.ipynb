    "# Tutorial Objectives\n",
    "This is the first in a series of two core tutorials on Bayesian statistics. In these tutorials, we will explore the fundemental concepts of the Bayesian approach from two perspectives. This tutorial will work through an example of Bayesian inference and decision making using a binary hidden state. The second main tutorial extends these concepts to a continuous hidden state. In the next days, each of these basic ideas will be extended--first through time as we consider what happens when we infere a hidden state using multiple observations and when the hidden state changes across time. In the third day, we will introduce the notion of how to use inference and decisions to select actions for optimal control. For this tutorial, you will be introduced to our binary state fishing problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce the fundamental building blocks for Bayesian statistics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we use probability distributions to represent hidden states?\n",
    "2. How does marginalization work and how can we use it?\n",
    "3. How do we combine new information with our prior knowledge?\n",
    "4. How do we combine the possible loss (or gain) for making a decision with our probabilitic knowledge?\n"

In the next two sections we will consider just the probability of where the fish might be and what you gain or lose by choosing where to fish.\n",

Better yet, we sometimes don't need to bother with this normalization! The normalization term, $P(m)$, is the probability of the measurement. This does not depend on state so is essentially a constant we can often ignore. We can compare the unnormalized posterior distribution values for different states because how they relate to each other is unchanged when divided by the same constant.

Now we have all the components of a Bayesian decision: our prior information, the likelihood given a measurement, the posterior distribution (belief) and our utility (the gains and losses).
