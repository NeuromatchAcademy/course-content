1) No, no matter what parameters we choose for the Gaussian, the peak of the expected
   utility is the same. In other words, we would choose the same action (provide the same
   location estimate) for all 3 estimates.

2) Yes, the peak of expected utility is in different locations for each loss when using
   a mixture of Gaussians distribution.

3) When using mean-squared error, the peak is at the location of the mean. For
   absolute error, the peak is located at the median. And for zero-one loss, the
   peaks are at the two mode values.

4) When a distribution has more than one maximum, it is multi-modal! This means
   it can have more than one mode. You will only ever have one mean and one median.
