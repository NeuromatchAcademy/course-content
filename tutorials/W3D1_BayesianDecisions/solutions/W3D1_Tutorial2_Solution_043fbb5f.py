#. 1) As Astrocat's mean get closer to the mean of the gain (or loss), the EU become dominated
#.    by only the gain or loss.

#. 2) Only if the mean and variances of both the gain and loss regions are exactly the same.
# .   (Set one of the variances 0.01 more than the other to see this.)

#. 3) If the variances of the gain and loss function are small enough relative to the position
#.    of Astrocat, there will be a 'neutral' region. As the variances increase, this will go away.

#. 4) As the uncertainty of Astrocat's location increases (relative to the gain and loss variances).
#.    there will be a continuous increase in utility from the peak of the loss region to the peak of the
#.    gain region. Also, this will depend on the mean of Astrocat's distribution! The larger the variance
#.    the more sensitive the expected utility is to both the gains and losses!
