1) If we do not use a Gaussian prior, we will not necessarily have a Gaussian
   posterior as the type of posterior distribution depends on the types of both the
   prior and likelihood distributions.

2) A flat prior means you have no helpful prior information coming in: all options are
   equally likely.

3) The Gamma prior has skew, which is the property of not being symmetric, so, like the
   mixture of Gaussians, it has different mean, median and mode. But unlike all the other
   distributions, the Gamma PDF is positive only for x > 0, so it has a hard truncation,
   even when its parameters cause the values just above x = 0 to be large. In fact, the
   the Exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, and chi-square distribution are
   special cases of the gamma distribution. In our example, you can see that the posterior
   also incoreporates the hard truncation.

4) We have only changed the prior, but the prior and the likelihood are just probability
   distributions. In principle, they can be any properly defined probability distribution.
   An example that may seem bizare is the Driac (delta) function, which is a PDF, that has
   all it's probability density in one location, desite being continuous. But in the case
   of the brain, it's possible that strange likelihood distributions could be used. However,
   for the same reasons we, as scientists, like exponential family distributions, it may be
   that evolution selected only ways of representing probability distributions that had useful
   properties.
