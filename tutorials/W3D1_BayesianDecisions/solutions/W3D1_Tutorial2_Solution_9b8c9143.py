1) Information is ~ 1/variance, so the new information you have is roughly 1/(0.5^2 + 0.5^2)
   (compared to 1/0.5^2) for each original measurement.

2) The estimate will be almost entirely dependent on the mu_{1}! There is almost no
   information from mu_{2}.

3) Because the variances are the same, the amount of information you have about the center
   is lower (very low in fact), but the mean doesn't change!

4) There are an infinite number of variances that will produce the same (relative) weighting.
   The only thing that matters is the relative means and relative variances!

5) This is the same intuition, it's the relative weightings that matter, so you can only
   think about the result (in this case the variance of the second Gaussian) relative to
   the first.

6) As the variances -> zero, the amount of information goes to infinity!
