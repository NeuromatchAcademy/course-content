1. There are actually many (infinite) combinations that can produce the same
   expected utility for both actions: but the posterior probabilities will always
   have to balance out the differences in the utility function. So, what is
   important is that for a given utility function, there will be some 'point
   of indifference'

2. What matters is the relative information: if the prior is close to 50/50,
   then the likelihood has more infuence, if the likelihood is 50/50 given a
   measurement (the measurement is uninformative), the prior is more important.
   But the critical insite from Bayes Rule and the Bayesian approach is that what
   matters is the relative information you gain from a measurement, and that
   you can use all of this information for your decision.

3. The model gives us a very precise way to think about how we *should* combine
   information and how we *should* act, GIVEN some assumption about our goals.
   In this case, if we assume we are trying to maximize expected utility--we can
   state what an animal or subject should do.

4. There are lots of possible extensions. Humans may not always try to maximize
   utility; humans and animals might not be able to calculate or represent probabiltiy
   distributions exactly; The utility function might be more complicated; etc.
