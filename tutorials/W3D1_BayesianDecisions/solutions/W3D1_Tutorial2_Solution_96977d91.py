1) As Astrocat's mean get closer to the mean of the gain (or loss), the EU become dominated
   by only the gain or loss.

2) Only if the mean and variances of both the gain and loss regions are exactly the same.
   (Set one of the variances 0.01 more than the other to see this.)

3) If the variances of the gain and loss function are small enough relative to the position
   of Astrocat, there will be a 'neutral' region. As the variances increase, this will go away.

4) As the uncertainty of Astrocat's location increases (relative to the gain and loss variances).
   there will be a continuous increase in utility from the peak of the loss region to the peak of the
   gain region. Also, this will depend on the mean of Astrocat's distribution! The larger the variance
   the more sensitive the expected utility is to both the gains and losses!
