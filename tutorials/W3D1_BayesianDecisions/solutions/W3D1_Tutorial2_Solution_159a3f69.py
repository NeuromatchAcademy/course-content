1) The higher the correlation, the more shared information there is. So, the probabilities of the
   second hidden state are more dependent on the first (and vice versa).

2) The means control only the location! The variances determine the spread in X and Y. The
   correlation is the only factor that controls the degree of the 'rotation', where we can think
   about the correlation as forcing the distribution to be more along one of the diagonals or ther
   other.

3) We would need to marginalize! We will do this next.
