1. The minimium of the different loss functions correspond to the mean, median,
   and mode of the posterior (just as in Interactive Demo 3). If we have a bi-modal
   prior, those properties of the posterior can be distinct.

2. The posterior is just another probability distribution, so all the properies we
   saw in Interactive Demo 3, are true of the posterior twoâ€”-even though in this case,
   the posterior inherited the non-symetric properties from the prior. So, in this
   example, any prior that itself has a different mean, median and mode with also
   produce differents across their equivilant Loss functions.

3. As long as the posterior probability densities are symetric around the true mean
   (hidden state), the MSE and ABS loss functions will look the same as for a Gaussian
   prior. The mean and the median are the same for symetric distributions. (When the
   mean exists--look up the Cauchy distributions.) The mode will be the same as the
   mean and median, when the distribution is unimodal (and therefor when the mixture
   means are the same. There can also be two modes with the mixture prior!
