1. When the correlation is zero, the two properties are completely independent.
   This means you don't gain any information about one variable from observing the other.
   Importantly, the marginal distribution of one variable is therefore independent of the other.

2. The correlation controls the distribution of probability across the joint probabilty table.
   The higher the correlation, the more the probabilities are restricted by the fact that both rows
   and columns need to sum to one! While the marginal probabilities show the relative weighting, the
   absolute probabilities for one quality will become more dependent on the other as the correlation
   goes to 1 or -1.

3. The correlation will control how much probabilty mass is located on the diagonals. As the
   correlation goes to 1 (or -1), the probability of seeing the one of the two pairings has to goes
   towards zero!

4. If we think about what information we gain by observing one quality, the intution from (3.) tells
   us that we know more (have more information) about the other quality as a function of the correlation.
