1) The fisherperson is on the left side so:
      - P(m = fish | s = left) = 0.7 because they have a 70% chance of catching
        a fish when on the same side as the school
      - P(m = no fish | s = left) = 0.3 because the probability of catching a fish
        and not catching a fish for a given state must add up to 1 as these
        are the only options: 1 - 0.7 = 0.3
      - P(m = fish | s = right) = 0.2
      - P(m = no fish | s = right) = 0.8

2) If the fisherperson catches a fish, you would guess the school of fish is on the
    left side. This is because the probability of catching a fish given that the
   school is on the left side (0.7) is higher than the probability given that
   the school is on the right side (0.2).

3) If the fisherperson does not catch a fish, you would guess the school of fish is on the
    right side. This is because the probability of not catching a fish given that the
   school is on the right side (0.8) is higher than the probability given that
   the school is on the right side (0.3).
