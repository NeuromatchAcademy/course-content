1)  When you have a weak prior and likelihood (high variance for both so not
     informative), the utility function heavily dictates the shape of the expected utility
     and final decision (the location of the max of the expected utility)

2) How much it helps guide your decision depends on the prior and utility function.
   If the likelihood is much more informative that the prior (lower variance), it
   will help clarify your decision of location quite a bit.

3) None are always the "most important". It depends on the interplay of all components,
   especially the information of the prior and likelihood. If you have an informative
   prior, that will heavily influence the posterior and thus the expected utility.
   If you have an informative likelihood, that will drive the posterior. And if neither
   is informative, the utility function becomes very important,
