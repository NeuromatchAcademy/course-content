1) Increasing the weight parameter makes the mixture distribution more closely
   resemble p(x). This makes sense because it is weighting p(x) in the sum of Gaussians.


2) You can move the two bumps of the mixture model further apart by making the means
   u_1 and u_2 of the two Gaussians more different (having one at -4 and one at 4 for
   example)


3) If you make the means of the two Gaussians very similar, the mixture will resemble
    a single Gaussian (u_1 = 0.25, u_2 = 0.3 for example)

4) You can make a bunch of shapes if the two Gaussian components overlap at all.
   If they're completely separated, you'll just get two Gaussian looking bumps
