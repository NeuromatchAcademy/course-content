# 1)  With equal probabilities, the expected utility is higher on the left side,
#    since that is the side without submarines, so you would choose to fish there.

# 2)  If the probability that the fish is on the right side is high, you would
#     choose to fish there. The high probability of fish being on the right far outweights
#    the slightly higher utilities from fishing on the left (as you are unlikely to gain these)

# 3)  If the probability that the fish is on the right side is just slightly higher
#.    than on the left, you would choose the left side as the expected utility is still
#.    higher on the left. Note that in this situation, you are not simply choosing the
#.    side with the higher probability - the utility really matters here for the decision
