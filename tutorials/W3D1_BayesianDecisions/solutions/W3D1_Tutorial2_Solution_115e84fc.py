#. 1. Increasing u moves the distribution to the right along the x-axis. The center
#.    of the distribution equals u - which makes sense as this is the mean! Increasing
#.    the standard deviation makes the distribution wider.

#.  2. Yes, you can! For example, keep the standard deviation the same and move the mean
#.     from -2 to 2. At both of these, the probability at 0 is the same because the distribution
#.     is symmetrical.

#.  3. There are an infinite number of Gaussians (combinations of mean & standard deviation)
#.     that could produce the same probability at 0
