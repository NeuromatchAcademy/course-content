1. Using Bayes rule, we know that P(s = left | m = fish) = P(m = fish | s = left)P(s = left) / P(m = fish)

   Let's first compute P(m = fish):
   P(m = fish) =  P(m = fish | s = left)P(s = left) +  P(m = fish | s = right)P(s = right)
               = 0.5 * 0.3 + .1 * .7
               = 0.22

   Now we can plug in all parts of Bayes rule:
   P(s = left | m = fish) = P(m = fish | s = left)P(s = left) / P(m = fish)
                          = 0.5 * 0.3 / 0.22
                          = 0.68

2. Using Bayes rule, we know that P(s = right | m = no fish) = P(m = no fish | s = right)P(s = right) / P(m = no fish)

   Let's first compute P(m = no fish):
   P(m = no fish) = P(m = no fish | s = left)P(s = left) +  P(m = no fish | s = right)P(s = right)
                  = 0.5 * 0.3 + .9 * .7
                  = 0.78

   Now we can plug in all parts of Bayes rule:
   P(s = right | m = no fish) = P(m = no fish | s = right)P(s = right) / P(m = no fish)
                              = 0.9 * 0.7 / 0.78
                              = 0.81
