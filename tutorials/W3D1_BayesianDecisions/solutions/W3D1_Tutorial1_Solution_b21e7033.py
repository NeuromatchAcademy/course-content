1)  With equal probabilities, the expected utility is higher on the left side,
   since that is the side without submarines, so you would choose to fish there.

2)  If the probability that the fish is on the right side is high, you would
    choose to fish there. The high probability of fish being on the right far outweights
   the slightly higher utilities from fishing on the left (as you are unlikely to gain these)

3)  If the probability that the fish is on the right side is just slightly higher
    than on the left, you would choose the left side as the expected utility is still
    higher on the left. Note that in this situation, you are not simply choosing the
    side with the higher probability - the utility really matters here for the decision
