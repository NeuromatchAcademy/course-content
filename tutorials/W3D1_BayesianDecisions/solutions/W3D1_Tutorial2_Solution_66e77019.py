1. Increasing u moves the distribution to the right along the x-axis. The center
   of the distribution equals u - which makes sense as this is the mean! Increasing
   the standard deviation makes the distribution wider.

2. Yes, you can! For example, keep the standard deviation the same and move the mean
   from -2 to 2. At both of these, the probability at 0 is the same because the distribution
   is symmetrical.

3. There are an infinite number of Gaussians (combinations of mean & standard deviation)
   that could produce the same probability at 0
