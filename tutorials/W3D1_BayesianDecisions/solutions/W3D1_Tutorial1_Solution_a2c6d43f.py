1. The probability of a fish being silver is the joint probability of it being
     small and silver plus the joint probability of it being large and silver:

    P(Y = silver) = P(X = small, Y = silver) + P(X = large, Y = silver)
                  = 0.4 + 0.1
                  = 0.5


2. This is all the possibilities as in this scenario, our fish can only be small
   or large, silver or gold. So the probability is 1 - the fish has to be at
   least one of these.


3. First we compute the marginal probabilities
   P(X = small) = P(X = small, Y = silver) + P(X = small, Y = gold) = 0.6
   P(Y = gold) = P(X = small, Y = gold) + P(X = large, Y = gold) = 0.5

   We already know the joint probability: P(X = small, Y = gold) = 0.2

   We can now use the given formula:
   P( X = small or Y = gold) = P(X = small) + P(Y = gold) - P(X = small, Y = gold)
                             = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.2
                             = 0.9
