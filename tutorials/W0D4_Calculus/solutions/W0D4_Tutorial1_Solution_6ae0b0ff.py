2) $\theta$ shifts the neuron transfer function along the x-axis -- reducing $theta$ moves the transfer function leftwards.
So changing $\theta$ will affect the value of $I$ at which the neuron has the maximal slope.
Smaller the $\theta$ smaller the value for maximum slope.

3) $a$ controls the steepness of the neuron transfer function -- increasing $a$ makes the curve more steeper.
Therefore, $a$ determines the maximum value of the slope.

Note $a$ and $\theta$ do not determine the maximum value of the transfer function itself.
