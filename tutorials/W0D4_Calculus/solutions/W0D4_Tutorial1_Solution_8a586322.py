2) Change terms involving x to just be linear (a constant times x, or a constant times x times some function of y).
Change a term involving y to involve more than y or y^2. For example, x +  2*x*y + y**3

3) If there are no terms involving both x and y, the partial derivative with respect to x will
   just depend on x and the partial derivative with respect to y will just depend on y.
