  1. Negative values of alpha result in an exponential decrease to 0 a stable solution.
  2. Positive Values of alpha in an exponential increases to infinity.
  3. Alpha equal to 0 is a unique point known as an equilibrium point when the
  dp/dt=0 and there is no change in population. This is known as a stable point.
