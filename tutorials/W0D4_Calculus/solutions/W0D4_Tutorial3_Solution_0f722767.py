  1. Personal preference: both have their benefits
  2. The solution is stable.
  3. The quadrants are:
    - Top right positive derivative for inhibition and  negative for excitation (r_I increases, r_E decreases)
    - top left negative derivative for both inhibition and excitation (r_I decrease, r_E decrease)
    - bottom left negative derivative for inhibition and  positive for excitation (r_I decrease, r_E increase)
    - bottom right positive derivative for inhibition and excitation (r_I increase, r_E increase)
