  1. Personal preference: both have their benefits
  2. The solution is stable.
  3. The quadrants are:
  -  bottom left negative derivative for both inhibition and excitation (ie both decrease)
  - bottom right negative derivative for inhibition, positive derivative for excitation ( inhibition decreases, excitation increases)
  - top left negative derivative for excitation, positive derivative for inhibition ( excitation decreases, inhibition increases)
  - bottom right positive derivative for inhibition and excitation ( inhibition increases, excitation increases)
