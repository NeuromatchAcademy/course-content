    "*Estimated timing of tutorial: 45 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "A great deal of neuroscience can be modelled using differential equations, from gating channels to single neurons to a network of neurons to blood flow, to behaviour. A simple way to think about differential equations is they are equations that describe how something changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous of these in neuroscience is the Nobel Prize winning Hodgkin Huxley equation, which describes a neuron by modelling the gating of each axon. But we will not start there; we will start a few steps back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Equations are mathematical equations that describe how something like population or a neuron changes over time. The reason why differential equations are so useful is they can generalise a process such that one equation can be used to describe many different outcomes.\n",
    "The general form of a first order differential equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dt}y(t)&=f(t,y(t))\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be read as \"the change in a process $y$ over time $t$ is a function $f$ of time $t$ and itself $y$\". This might initially seem like a paradox as you are using a process $y$ you want to know about to describe itself, a bit like the MC Escher drawing of two hands painting [each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands). But that is the beauty of mathematics - this can be solved some of time, and when it cannot be solved exactly we can use numerical methods to estimate the answer (as we will see in the next tutorial). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will see how __differential equations are motivated by observations of physical responses.__ We will break down the population differential equation, then the integrate and fire model, which leads nicely into raster plots and frequency-current curves to rate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "- Get an intuitive understanding of a linear population differential equation (humans, not neurons)\n",
    "- Visualize the relationship between the change in population and the population\n",
    "- Breakdown the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) differential equation\n",
    "- Code the exact solution of an LIF for a constant input\n",
    "- Visualize and listen to the response of the LIF for different inputs\n"
