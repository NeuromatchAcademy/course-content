    "Calculus is a part of mathematics concerned with **continous change**. There are two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation of a function $f(t)$ gives you the derivative of that function $\\frac{d(f(t))}{dt}$. A derivative captures how sensitive a function is to slight changes in the input for different ranges of inputs. Geometrically, the derivative of a function at a certain input is the slope of the function at that input. For example, as you drive, the distance traveled changes continuously with time. The derivative of the distance traveled with respect to time is the velocity of the vehicle at each point in time. The velocity tells you the rate of change of the distance traveled at different points in time. If you have slow velocity (a small derivative), the distance traveled doesn't change much for small changes in time. A high velocity (big derivative) means that the distance traveled changes a lot for small changes in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign of the derivative of a function (or signal) tells whether the signal is increasing or decreasing. For a signal going through changes as a function of time, the derivative will become zero when the signal changes its direction of change (e.g. from increasing to decreasing). That is, at local minimum or maximum values, the slope of the signal will be zero. This property is used in optimizing problems. But we can also use it to find peaks in a signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integration can be thought of as the reverse of differentation. If we integrate the velocity with respect to time, we can calculate the distance traveled. By integrating a function, we are basically trying to find functions that would have the original one as their derivative. When we integrate a function, our integral will have an added unknown scalar constant, $C$. \n",
    "For example, if $$ g(t) = 1.5t^2 + 4t - 1$$\n",

    "$$ f(t) = \\int g(t) dt = 0.5t^3 + 2t^2 - t + C$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constant exists because the derivative of a constant is 0 so we cannot know what the constant should be. This is an indefinite integral. If we compute a definite integral, that is the integral between two limits of the input, we will not have this unknown constant and the integral of a function will capture the area under the curve of that function between those two limits.\n",
