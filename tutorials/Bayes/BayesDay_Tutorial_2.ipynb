    "We now want to create a Binary Decision Matrix. To do so, we will scan the Posterior matrix (i.e. row_wise), and set the matrix cell to 1 at the mode of the row posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, effectively encodes the *decision* that a participant may make on a given trial (i.e. row). In this case, the modelled decision rule is to take the mode of the posterior on each trial.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Create a matrix of the same size as the Posterior matrix and fill it with zeros (Hint: use `np.zeros_like()`).\n",
    "* For each row (trial) of the Posterior matrix, calculate the mode of the posterior, and set the corresponding cell of the Binary Decision Matrix to 1. (e.g. if the mode of the posterior is at position 0, then set the cell with x_column == 0 to 1).\n",
    "* Plot the matrix using the function `plt.pcolor` already pre-written and commented-out in your script\n",
    "  - Notice how `p_color` displays the y-values of the matrix in reverse order (row 0 at the bottom, and row 20 at the top)"
