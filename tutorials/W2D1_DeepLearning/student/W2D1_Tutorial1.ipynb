    "\n",
    "*Estimated timing of tutorial: 1 hr, 20 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use deep learning to decode stimulus information from the responses of sensory neurons. Specifically, we'll look at the activity of ~20,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex responding to oriented gratings recorded in [this study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679324v2.abstract). Our task will be to decode the orientation of the presented stimulus from the responses of the whole population of neurons. We could do this in a number of ways, but here we'll use deep learning. Deep learning is particularly well-suited to this problem for a number of reasons:\n",
    "* The data are very high-dimensional: the neural response to a stimulus is a ~20,000 dimensional vector. Many machine learning techniques fail in such high dimensions, but deep learning actually thrives in this regime, as long as you have enough data (which we do here!).\n",
    "* As you'll be able to see below, different neurons can respond quite differently to stimuli. This complex pattern of responses will, therefore, require non-linear methods to be decoded, which we can easily do with non-linear activation functions in deep networks.\n",
    "* Deep learning architectures are highly flexible, meaning we can easily adapt the architecture of our decoding model to optimize decoding. Here, we'll focus on a single architecture, but you'll see that it can easily be modified with few changes to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely, our goal will be learn how to:\n",
    "* Build a deep feed-forward network using PyTorch\n",
    "* Evaluate the network's outputs using PyTorch built-in loss functions\n",
    "* Compute gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter of the network using automatic differentiation\n",
    "* Implement gradient descent to optimize the network's parameters\n"

    "Generalized linear models were used as decoding and encoding models in W1D4 Machine Learning. A model that decodes a variable from neural activity can tell us *how much information* a brain area contains about that variable. An encoding model is a model from an input variable, like visual stimulus, to neural activity. The encoding model is meant to approximate the same transformation that the brain performs on input variables and therefore help us understand *how the brain represents information*. Today we will use deep neural networks to build these models because deep neural networks can approximate a wide range of non-linear functions and can be easily fit. \n",

We record neural activity using a technique called two-photon calcium imaging, which allows us to record many thousands of neurons simultanously. The neurons light up when they fire.

For the purposes of this tutorial we are going to bin the neural responses and compute each neuron’s tuning curve. We used bins of 1 degree. We will use the response of all neurons in a single bin to try to predict which stimulus was shown.

    "Here, we'll use the **PyTorch** package to build, run, and train deep networks of this form in Python. PyTorch uses a data type called a `torch.Tensor`. `torch.Tensor`'s are effectively just like a `numpy` arrays, except that they have some important attributes and methods needed for automatic differentiation (to be discussed below). They also come along with infrastructure for easily storing and computing with them on GPU's, a capability we won't touch on here but which can be really useful in practice.\n",

    "First we import the pytorch library called `torch` and its neural network module `nn`. Next we will create a class for the deep network called DeepNet. A class has functions which are called methods. A class in python is initialized using a method called `__init__`. In this case the init method is declared to takes two inputs (other than the `self` input which represents the class itself), which are `n_inputs` and `n_hidden`. In our case `n_inputs` is the number of neurons we are using to do the prediction, and `n_hidden` is the number of hidden units. We first call the super function to invoke the `nn.Module`’s init function. Next we add the hidden layer `in_layer` as an attribute of the class. It is a linear layer called `nn.Linear` with size `n_inputs` by `n_hidden`. Then we add a second linear layer `out_layer` of size `n_hidden` by `1`, because we are predicting one output - the orientation of the stimulus. PyTorch will initialize all weights and biases randomly.\n",

    "Next we add another method to the class called `forward`. This is the method that runs when you call the class as a function. It takes as input `r` which is the neural responses. Then `r` is sent through the linear layers `in_layer` and `out_layer` and returns our prediction `y`. Let’s create an instantiation of this class called `net` with 200 hidden units with `net = DeepNet(n_neurons, 200)`. Now we can run the neural response through the network to predict the stimulus (`net(r)`); running the “net” this way calls the forward method.\n",

It works well because the gradient is able to back-propagate through the network as long as the input is positive - the gradient is 1 for all values of x greater than 0.

    "## Bonus Section 1: Neural network *depth*, *width* and *expressivity*\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important architectural choices that always have to be made when constructing deep feed-forward networks like those used here are\n",
    "* the number of hidden layers, or the network's *depth*\n",
    "* the number of units in each layer, or the layer *widths*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we restricted ourselves to networks with a single hidden layer with a width of $M$ units, but it is easy to see how this code could be adapted to arbitrary depths. Adding another hidden layer simply requires adding another `nn.Linear` module to the `__init__()` method and incorporating it into the `.forward()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth and width of a network determine the set of input/output transormations that it can perform, often referred to as its *expressivity*. The deeper and wider the network, the more *expressive* it is; that is, the larger the class of input/output transformations it can compute. In fact, it turns out that an infinitely wide *or* infinitely deep networks can in principle [compute (almost) *any* input/output transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic mathematical demonstration of the power of depth is given by the so-called [XOR problem](https://medium.com/@jayeshbahire/the-xor-problem-in-neural-networks-50006411840b#:~:text=The%20XOr%2C%20or%20%E2%80%9Cexclusive%20or,value%20if%20they%20are%20equal.). This toy problem demonstrates how even a single hidden layer can drastically expand the set of input/output transformations a network can perform, relative to a shallow network with no hidden layers. The key intuition is that the hidden layer allows you to represent the input in a new format, which can then allow you to do almost anything you want with it. The *wider* this hidden layer, the more flexibility you have in this representation. In particular, if you have more hidden units than input units, then the hidden layer representation of the input is higher-dimensional than the raw data representation. This higher dimensionality effectively gives you more \"room\" to perform arbitrary computations in. It turns out that even with just this one hidden layer, if you make it wide enough you can actually approximate any input/output transformation you want. See [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) for a neat visual demonstration of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, it turns out that increasing depth seems to grant more expressivity with fewer units than increasing width does (for reasons that are not well understood). It is for this reason that truly *deep* networks are almost always used in machine learning, which is why this set of techniques is often referred to as *deep* learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there is a cost to making networks deeper and wider. The bigger your network, the more parameters (i.e. weights and biases) it has, which need to be optimized! The extra expressivity afforded by higher width and/or depth thus carries with it (at least) two problems:\n",
    "* optimizing more parameters usually requires more data\n",
    "* a more highly parameterized network is more prone to overfit to the training data, so requires more sophisticated optimization algorithms to ensure generalization"

In the syntax of our `train()` function above, $\\mathbf{r}^{(n)}$ is given by `train_data[n, :]` and $\\tilde{y}^{(n)}$ by `train_labels[n]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "  More specifically, when this function is called on a particular variable (e.g. `loss`, as above), PyTorch will compute the gradients with respect to each network parameter. These are computed and stored behind the scenes, and can be accessed through the `.grad` attribute of each of the network's parameters. As we saw above, however, we actually never need to look at or call these gradients when implementing gradient descent, as this can be taken care of by PyTorch's built-in optimizers, like `optim.SGD`.\n",

In SGD, on the other hand, we evaluate the loss only at a random subset of data samples from the full training set, called a **mini-batch**. At each iteration, we randomly sample a mini-batch to perform steps 1-3 on. All the above equations still hold, but now the $P$ data samples $\\mathbf{r}^{(n)}, \\tilde{y}^{(n)}$ denote a mini-batch of $P$ random samples from the training set, rather than the whole training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why one might want to use SGD instead of GD. The first is that the training set might be too big, so that we actually can't actually evaluate the loss on every single data sample in it. In this case, GD is simply infeasible, so we have no choice but to turn to SGD, which bypasses the restrictive memory demands of GD by sub-sampling the training set into smaller mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, even when GD is feasible, SGD turns out to often be better. The stochasticity induced by the extra random sampling step in SGD effectively adds some noise in the search for local minima of the loss function. This can be really useful for avoiding potential local minima, and enforce that whatever minimum is converged to is a good one. This is particularly important when networks are wider and/or deeper, in which case the large number of parameters can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we used only GD because (1) it is simpler, and (2) it suffices for the problem being considered here. Because we have so many neurons in our data set, decoding is not too challenging and doesn't require a particularly deep or wide network. The small number of parameters in our deep networks therefore can be optimized without a problem using GD."
