    "# Tutorial Objectives\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use deep learning to decode stimulus information from the responses of sensory neurons. Specifically, we'll look at the activity of ~20,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex responding to oriented gratings recorded in [this study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679324v2.abstract). Our task will be to decode the orientation of the presented stimulus from the responses of the whole population of neurons. We could do this in a number of ways, but here we'll use deep learning. Deep learning is particularly well-suited to this problem for a number of reasons:\n",
    "* The data are very high-dimensional: the neural response to a stimulus is a ~20,000 dimensional vector. Many machine learning techniques fail in such high dimensions, but deep learning actually thrives in this regime, as long as you have enough data (which we do here!).\n",
    "* As you'll be able to see below, different neurons can respond quite differently to stimuli. This complex pattern of responses will, therefore, require non-linear methods to be decoded, which we can easily do with non-linear activation functions in deep networks.\n",
    "* Deep learning architectures are highly flexible, meaning we can easily adapt the architecture of our decoding model to optimize decoding. Here, we'll focus on a single architecture, but you'll see that it can easily be modified with few changes to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely, our goal will be learn how to:\n",
    "* Build a deep feed-forward network using PyTorch\n",
    "* Evaluate the network's outputs using PyTorch built-in loss functions\n",
    "* Compute gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter of the network using automatic differentiation\n",
    "* Implement gradient descent to optimize the network's parameters\n",
    "* (Bonus) Learn how to regularize the optimization\n"

    "Here, we'll use the **PyTorch** package to build, run, and train deep networks of this form in Python. There are two core components to the PyTorch package: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first is the `torch.Tensor` data type used in PyTorch. `torch.Tensor`'s are effectively just like a `numpy` arrays, except that they have some important attributes and methods needed for automatic differentiation (to be discussed below). They also come along with infrastructure for easily storing and computing with them on GPU's, a capability we won't touch on here but which can be really useful in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second core ingredient is the PyTorch `nn.Module` class. This is the class we'll use for constructing deep networks, so that we can then easily train them using built-in PyTorch functions. Keep in my mind that `nn.Module` classes can actually be used to build, run, and train any model -- not just deep networks!\n",
    "\n",
    "  The next cell contains code for building the deep network we defined above using the `nn.Module` class. It contains three key ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `__init__()` method to initialize its parameters, like in any other Python class. In this case, it takes two arguments:\n",
    "    * `n_inputs`: the number of input units. This should always be set to the number of neurons whose activities are being decoded (i.e. the dimensionality of the input to the network). \n",
    "    * `n_hidden`: the number of hidden units. This is a parameter that we are free to vary in deciding how to build our network. See Bonus Section 1 for a discussion of how this architectural choice affects the computations the network can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `nn.Linear` modules, which are built-in PyTorch classes containing all the weights and biases for a given network layer (documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)). This class takes two arguments to initialize:\n",
    "    * \\# of inputs to that layer\n",
    "    * \\# of outputs from that layer\n",
    "\n",
    "    For the input layer, for example, we have:\n",
    "    * \\# of inputs = \\# of neurons whose responses are to be decoded ($N$, specified by `n_inputs`)\n",
    "    * \\# of outputs = \\# of hidden layer units ($M$, specified by `n_hidden`)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    PyTorch will initialize all weights and biases randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `forward()` method, which takes as argument an input to the network and returns the network output. In our case, this comprises computing the output $y$ from a given input $\\mathbf{r}$ using the above two equations.

    "Our goal is now to modify the weights to make the mean squared error loss $L$ as small as possible over the whole data set. To do this, we'll use the **gradient descent (GD)** algorithm, which consists of iterating three steps:\n",
    "1. **Evaluate the loss** on the training data,\n",
    "```\n",
    "out = net(train_data)\n",
    "loss = loss_fn(out, train_labels)\n",

    "```\n",
    "loss.backward()\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Update the network weights** by descending the gradient. In Pytorch, we can do this using built-in optimizers. We'll use the `optim.SGD` optimizer (documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.SGD)) which updates parameters along the negative gradient, scaled by a learning rate (see Bonus Section 2.1 for details). To initialize this optimizer, we have to tell it\n",
    "  * which parameters to update, and\n",
    "  * what learning rate to use\n",

    "  optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=.001)\n",

    "  \n",
    "  After computing all the parameter gradients in step 2, we can then update each of these parameters using the `.step()` method of this optimizer,\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  optimizer.step()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an important detail to remember is that the gradients of each parameter need to be cleared before calling `.backward()`, or else PyTorch will try to accumulate gradients across iterations. This can again be done using built-in optimizers via the method `zero_grad()`, as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "optimizer.zero_grad()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all this together, each iteration of the GD algorith will contain a block of code that looks something like this:\n",

    "In the next exercise, we'll give you a code skeleton for implementing the GD algorithm. Your job will be to fill in the blanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mathematical details of the GD algorithm, see Bonus Section 2.1. Note, in particular, that here we using the gradient descent algorithm, rather than the more commonly used *stochastic* gradient descent algorithm. See Bonus Section 2.2 for a more detailed discussion of how these differ and when one might need to use the stochastic variant."

    "## Bonus Section 1: Neural network *depth*, *width* and *expressivity*\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important architectural choices that always have to be made when constructing deep feed-forward networks like those used here are\n",
    "* the number of hidden layers, or the network's *depth*\n",
    "* the number of units in each layer, or the layer *widths*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we restricted ourselves to networks with a single hidden layer with a width of $M$ units, but it is easy to see how this code could be adapted to arbitrary depths. Adding another hidden layer simply requires adding another `nn.Linear` module to the `__init__()` method and incorporating it into the `.forward()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth and width of a network determine the set of input/output transormations that it can perform, often referred to as its *expressivity*. The deeper and wider the network, the more *expressive* it is; that is, the larger the class of input/output transformations it can compute. In fact, it turns out that an infinitely wide *or* infinitely deep networks can in principle [compute (almost) *any* input/output transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic mathematical demonstration of the power of depth is given by the so-called [XOR problem](https://medium.com/@jayeshbahire/the-xor-problem-in-neural-networks-50006411840b#:~:text=The%20XOr%2C%20or%20%E2%80%9Cexclusive%20or,value%20if%20they%20are%20equal.). This toy problem demonstrates how even a single hidden layer can drastically expand the set of input/output transformations a network can perform, relative to a shallow network with no hidden layers. The key intuition is that the hidden layer allows you to represent the input in a new format, which can then allow you to do almost anything you want with it. The *wider* this hidden layer, the more flexibility you have in this representation. In particular, if you have more hidden units than input units, then the hidden layer representation of the input is higher-dimensional than the raw data representation. This higher dimensionality effectively gives you more \"room\" to perform arbitrary computations in. It turns out that even with just this one hidden layer, if you make it wide enough you can actually approximate any input/output transformation you want. See [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) for a neat visual demonstration of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, it turns out that increasing depth seems to grant more expressivity with fewer units than increasing width does (for reasons that are not well understood). It is for this reason that truly *deep* networks are almost always used in machine learning, which is why this set of techniques is often referred to as *deep* learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there is a cost to making networks deeper and wider. The bigger your network, the more parameters (i.e. weights and biases) it has, which need to be optimized! The extra expressivity afforded by higher width and/or depth thus carries with it (at least) two problems:\n",
    "* optimizing more parameters usually requires more data\n",
    "* a more highly parameterized network is more prone to overfit to the training data, so requires more sophisticated optimization algorithms to ensure generalization"

In the syntax of our `train()` function above, $\\mathbf{r}^{(n)}$ is given by `train_data[n, :]` and $\\tilde{y}^{(n)}$ by `train_labels[n]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "  More specifically, when this function is called on a particular variable (e.g. `loss`, as above), PyTorch will compute the gradients with respect to each network parameter.

As we saw above, however, we actually never need to look at or call these gradients when implementing gradient descent, as this can be taken care of by PyTorch's built-in optimizers, like `optim.SGD`.\n",

It should be as large as possible so that fewer iterations are needed, but not too large so as to avoid parameter updates from skipping over minima in the loss landscape.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Bonus Section 2.2: *Stochastic* gradient descent (SGD) vs. gradient descent (GD)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we used the gradient descent algorithm, which differs in a subtle yet very important way from the more commonly used **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** algorithm. The key difference is in the very first step of each iteration, where in the GD algorithm we evaluate the loss *at every data sample in the training set*. In SGD, on the other hand, we evaluate the loss only at a random subset of data samlpes from the full training set, called a **mini-batch**. At each iteration, we randomly sample a mini-batch to perform steps 1-3 on. All the above equations still hold, but now the $P$ data samples $\\mathbf{r}^{(n)}, \\tilde{y}^{(n)}$ denote a mini-batch of $P$ random samples from the training set, rather than the whole training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why one might want to use SGD instead of GD. The first is that the training set might be too big, so that we actually can't actually evaluate the loss on every single data sample in it. In this case, GD is simply infeasible, so we have no choice but to turn to SGD, which bypasses the restrictive memory demands of GD by sub-sampling the training set into smaller mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, even when GD is feasible, SGD turns out to be generally better. The stochasticity induced by the extra random sampling step in SGD effectively adds some noise in the search for local minima of the loss function. This can be really useful for avoiding potential local minima, and enforce that whatever minimum is converged to is a good one. This is particularly important when networks are wider and/or deeper, in which case the large number of parameters can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we used only GD because (1) it is simpler, and (2) it suffices for the problem being considered here. Because we have so many neurons in our data set, decoding is not too challenging and doesn't require a particularly deep or wide network. The small number of parameters in our deep networks therefore can be optimized without a problem using GD."
