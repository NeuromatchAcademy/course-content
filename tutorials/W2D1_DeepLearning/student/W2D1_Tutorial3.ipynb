    "In this tutorial, we'll be using deep learning to build an encoding model of the visual system, and then compare its internal representations to those observed in neural data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its parameters won't be directly optimized to fit the neural data. Instead, we will optimize its parameters to solve a particular visual task that we know the brain can solve. We therefore refer to it as a **\"normative\"** encoding model, since it is optimized for a specific behavioral task. It is the optimal model to solve the problem (optimal for the specified architecture).  See Section 3 of the bonus tutorial to fit a convolutional neural network directly to neural data (an alternative approach for investigating encoding with deep neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "To then evaluate whether this normative encoding model is actually a good model of the brain, we'll analyze its internal representations and compare them to the representations observed in mouse primary visual cortex. Since we understand exactly what the encoding model's representations are optimized to do, any similarities will hopefully shed light on why the representations in the brain look the way they do.\n",

    "More concretely, our goal will be learn how to:\n",
    "* Visualize and analyze the internal representations of a deep network\n",
    "* Quantify the similarity between distributed representations in a model and neural representations observed in recordings, using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)"

We could have used different neural network architectures, or even used a completely different algorithm that didn't involve a neural network at all, but instead used other kinds of image transformations (e.g. Fourier transforms). Neural network approaches, however, are special in that they explicitly uses abstract distributed representations to compute, which feels a lot closer to the kinds of algorithms the brain uses. *Convolutional* neural networks in particular are well-suited for building normative models of the visual system.\n",

Note again that we need to calculate the dimensions of its output in order to set the dimensions of the subsequent fully connected layer."
