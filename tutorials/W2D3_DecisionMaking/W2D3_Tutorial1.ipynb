You could get a sense of this by increasing noise level or decreasing stopping time in the last exercise.\n",

    "To illustrate the speed/accuracy tradeoff under thresholding stopping rule, let's run some simulations under different thresholds and look at how average decision \"speed\" (1/length) changes with average decision accuracy. We use speed rather than accuracy because in real experiments, subjects can be incentivized to respond faster or slower; it's much harder to precisely control their decision time or error threshold. \n",

You will need to supply code to calculate average decision 'speed' from the lengths of trials. You should also calculate the overall accuracy across these trials. \n",
