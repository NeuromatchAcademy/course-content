    "# Tutorial objectives\n",
    "Yesterday you gained some understanding of what models can buy us in neuroscience. But how do you build a model? Today, we will try to clarify the process of computational modeling, by thinking through the logic of modeling based on your project ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you have a general idea of a project in mind, i.e. a preliminary question, and/or phenomenon you would like to understand. You should have started developing a project idea yesterday with [this brainstorming demo](https://youtu.be/H6rSlZzlrgQ). Maybe you have a goal in mind. We will now work through the 4 first steps of modeling ([Blohm et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0352-19.2019)): \n",
    "\n",
    "**Framing the question**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. finding a phenomenon and a question to ask about it\n",
    "2. understanding the state of the art\n",
    "3. determining the basic ingredients\n",
    "4. formulating specific, mathematically defined hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining steps 5-10 will be covered in a second notebook that you can consult throughout the modeling process when you work on your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importantly**, we will guide you through Steps 1-4 today. After you do more work on projects, you likely have to revite some or all of these steps *before* you move on the the remaining steps of modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: there will be no coding today. It's important that you think through the different steps of this how-to-model tutorial to maximize your chance of succeeding in your group projects. **Also**: \"Models\" here can be data analysis pipelines, not just computational models...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think! Sections**: All activities you should perform are labeled with **Think!**. These are discussion based exercises and can be found in the Table of Content on the left side of the notebook. Make sure you complete all within a section before moving on!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demos\n",
    "We will demo the modeling process to you based on the train illusion. The introductory video will explain the phenomenon to you. Then we will do roleplay to showcase some common pitfalls to you based on a computational modeling project around the train illusion. In addition to the computational model, we will also provide a data neuroscience project example to you so you can appreciate similarities and differences. \n",
