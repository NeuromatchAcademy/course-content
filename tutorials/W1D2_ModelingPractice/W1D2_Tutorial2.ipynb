There are some extra considerations when publishing a model. In general, you should explain each of the steps in the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:** Steps 1 & 2 (maybe 3)\n",

    "**Methods:** Steps 3-7, 9\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** Steps 8 & 9, going back to 1, 2 & 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you should provide a visualization of the model, and upload the code implementing the model and the data it was trained and tested on to a repository (e.g. GitHub and OSF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The audience for all of this should be experimentalists, as they are the ones who can test predictions made by your your model and collect new data. This way your models can impact future experiments, and that future data can then be modeled (see modeling process schematic below). Remember your audience - it is _always_ hard to clearly convey the main points of your work to others, especially if your audience doesn't necessarily create computational models themselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Suggestion\n",
    "\n",
    "For every modeling project, a very good exercise in this is to _**first**_ write a short, 100-word abstract of the project plan and expected impact, like the summary you wrote. This forces focussing on the main points: describing the relevance, question, model, answer and what it all means very succinctly. This allows you to decide to do this project or not **before you commit time writing code for no good purpose**. Notice that this is really what we've walked you through carefully in this tutorial! :)\n"
