    "# Tutorial objectives\n",
    "Yesterday you gained some understanding of what models can buy us in neuroscience. But how do you build a model? Today, we will try to clarify the process of computational modeling, by thinking through the logic of modeling based on your project ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you have a general idea of a project in mind, i.e. a preliminary question, and/or phenomenon you would like to understand. You should have started developing a project idea yesterday with [this brainstorming demo](https://youtu.be/H6rSlZzlrgQ). Maybe you have a goal in mind. We will now work through the 4 first steps of modeling ([Blohm et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0352-19.2019)): \n",
    "\n",
    "**Framing the question**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. finding a phenomenon and a question to ask about it\n",
    "2. understanding the state of the art\n",
    "3. determining the basic ingredients\n",
    "4. formulating specific, mathematically defined hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining steps 5-10 will be covered in a second notebook that you can consult throughout the modeling process when you work on your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importantly**, we will guide you through Steps 1-4 today. After you do more work on projects, you likely have to revite some or all of these steps *before* you should move on the the remaining steps of modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: there will be no coding today. It's important that you think through the different steps of this how-to-model tutorial to maximize your chance of succeeding in your group projects.\n",
    "\n",
