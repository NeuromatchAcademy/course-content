Discussion:

In a limiting case, when the time constant of the OU process is very long and the
input current is almost flat, we expect the firing rate to decrease and neuron
will spike more regularly. So as the OU process time constant increases, we expect
firing rate and CV_ISI to decrease, if all other parameters are kept constant. We
can also relate the OU process time constant to the membrane time constant as the
neuron membrane does the same operation. This way we can link to the very first
interactive demo.
