Discussion:

1. The two groups will compete to get to stronger synaptic values

2. STDP provides a basis of unsupervised learning as these synapses are sensitive
to input correlations. So if the input data has any temporal correlation the
neuron will become responsive to those correlated events

3. You can for circuit motifs in an otherwise unstructured network. The simplest
function circuit we can make is a feedforward chain.
