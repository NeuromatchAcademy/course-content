If we have bigger current fluctuations (increased sigma), the minimum input needed
to make a neuron spike is smaller as the fluctuations can help push the voltage above
threshold.

The standard deviation (or size of current fluctuations) dictates the level of
irregularity of the spikes; the higher the sigma the more irregular the observed
spikes.
