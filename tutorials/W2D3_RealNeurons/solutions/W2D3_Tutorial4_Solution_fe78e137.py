Discussion:

As we increase the input firing rate, more synapses move to the extreme values,
either go to zero or to maximal conductance. Using 15Hz, the distribution of the
weights at the end of the simulation is more like a bell-shaped, skewed, with more
synapses to be potentiated. However, increasing the firing rate, in early times,
almost all synapses undergo depression, and then only a few escape and they become
potentiated.
