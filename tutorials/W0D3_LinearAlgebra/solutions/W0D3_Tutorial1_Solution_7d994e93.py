# 1) The direction of the retinal firing rate vector that maximially excites
#.   the LGN neuron is the direction of the weight vector.

# 2) The direction of the retinal firing rate vector that mimimally excites
#.   the LGN neuron is the opposite direction of the weight vector.

# 3) The LGN neuron has 0 firing rate when the firing rate vector is
#.   perpendicular to the weight vector


#. 4) The absolute value of the LGN firing rate grows bigger as the length
#.   of the retinal firing rate increase.


#. 5) You want a unit vector in the direction of the weight vector. You can just normalize
#.   the weight vector (divide by it's length), as we saw in Section 1!
