# 1) They are linearly dependent as one can be formed as a linear combination of
#     the others (a + b = c). You could also have known this because you have four
#.    3D vectors. You don't need 4 vectors to get anywhere in 3D space!
#.
# 2) The span of a, b, c, and d is all of 3D space (R^3).

# 3) The span of a, b, and c is a 2D plane through all of 3D space (note this is not R^2)

# 4) The span of a is a 1D line through 3D space (note this is not R^1)

# 5) The span of a and b is a 2d plane through 3D space (note this is not R^2)
