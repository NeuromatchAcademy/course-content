As you increase the process noise, you will notice that it becomes more
difficult to keep the state close to the goal g=0, even though we may have very
little measurement noise (thus can estimate the state exactly).

On the other hand, as you increase the measurement noise, you will notice that
it is harder to estimate the states, and this also may make it harder to keep the
state close to the goal.

Which has a larger effect? How does this effect the required action a[t]?
We will quantify these in the next section.
