    "# Tutorial objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This is tutorial 2 on our day of examining causality. Below is the high level outline of what we'll cover today, with the sections we will focus on in this tutorial in bold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Master definitions of causality\n",
    "2.   Understand that estimating causality is possible\n",
    "3.   Learn 4 different methods and understand when they fail\n",
    "    1. perturbations\n",
    "    2. **correlations**\n",
    "    3. simultaneous fitting/regression\n",
    "    5. instrumental variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial 2 objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In tutorial 1, we implemented and explored the dynamical system of neurons we will be working with throughout all of the tutorials today. We also learned about the \"gold standard\" of measuring causal effects through random perturbations. As random perturbations are often not possible, we will now turn to alternative methods to attempt to measure causality. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to estimate connectivity from observations assuming **correlations approximate causation**\n",
    "- Show that this only works when the network is small\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial 2 setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we can't force neural activites or brain areas to be on or off. We just have to observe. Maybe we can get the correlation between two nodes -- is that good enough? The question we ask in this tutorial is **when is correlation a \"good enough\" substitute for causation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is not \"never\", actually, but \"sometimes\".\n",
