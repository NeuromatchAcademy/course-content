# Suggested further readings

First, there are a number of different perspectives on causality from multiple communities.
Highly recommendable are:

### Statistics:


Pearl, Judea, and Dana Mackenzie. The book of why: the new science of cause and
effect . Basic Books, 2018 -> Super readable book on why causality matters so much. Not overly charitable about other communities.

Pearl, Judea. Causality . Cambridge university press, 2009 -> Foundational book for causal inference, DAG style and do- operators.

Hern n, Miguel A., and James M. Robins. " Causal inference: what if. " Boca Raton:
Chapman & Hill/CRC 2020 (2020) -> Beautifully applied and with code samples.

### Econometrics:


Angrist, Joshua D., and J rn-Steffen Pischke. Mastering metrics: The path from cause to
effect . Princeton University Press, 2014 -> Very readable book for practical causal inference

Angrist, Joshua D., and J rn-Steffen Pischke. Mostly harmless econometrics: An
empiricist's companion . Princeton university press, 2008. -> beautiful book highlighting the ways we can use real world data to get at causal estimates with strong computational treatments.

Imbens, Guido W., and Donald B. Rubin. Causal inference in statistics, social, and
biomedical sciences . Cambridge University Press, 2015. -> another very broad book.

### Epidemiology:

Aschengrau, Ann, and George R. Seage. Essentials of epidemiology in public health .
Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2013. -> This book shows how in epidemiology causality is often even harder than thought.

### Machine learning:

Peters, Jonas, Dominik Janzing, and Bernhard Sch lkopf. Elements of causal inference .
The MIT Press, 2017. -> This book combines Pearl type approaches with new ML inspired contributions.
