1)  By around 91 components, they're pretty clear and similar to the original data.
This means that the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is less than 100.

2) You can't see too much but you seem to be able to partially distinguish ones or other numbers with
a vertical straight line (like the 9) from the rest, which resemble 0 in the reconstruction. You could
probably usually distinguish 0s from 1s.
