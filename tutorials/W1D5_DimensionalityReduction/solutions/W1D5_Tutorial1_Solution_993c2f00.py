1) As you rotate the basis vectors, the look of the cloud of projected data changes.
Specifically, the correlations and variances of the projected data change.

2) As the angle increases, the correlation coefficient decreases, goes to 0, then starts
to become negative. It changes from 0.8 to -.8 when the angle is changed by 90 degrees.

With theta of 0, the data projected onto the two basis vectors has equal variances of 1.
As theta increases, these variances become unequal: the projected data has larger and larger variance
for basis vector 1 and smaller variance for basis vector 2. Past theta of 45, the trend reverses and
the variances start becoming more similar.

3) If theta is 45 degrees, the projected data is uncorrelated.
