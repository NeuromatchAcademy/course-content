1) As the absolute value of the correlation coefficient decreases, the two eigenvalues
become more similar (closer in value)

2) The two eigenvalues are extremely similar (basically equal) with a correlation coefficient of 0.

3) A correlation coefficient of 1 or -1 results in only one non-zero eigenvalues.
