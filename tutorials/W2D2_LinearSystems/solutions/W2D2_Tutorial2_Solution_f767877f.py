Discussion: 
(1) Does the general shape of the inter-switch interval distribution 
change or does it stay relatively the same? 
How does the bar graph of system states change based on these values?

Answers: 
(1) The shape of the distribution remains the same, but larger values of either 
c2o or o2c shifts the distribution towards shorter intervals.
(2) If c2o is larger than o2c, then the channel tends to be open a larger
fraction of the time.
