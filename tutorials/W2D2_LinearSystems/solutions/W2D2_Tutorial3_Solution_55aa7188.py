When mu is 0, the solutions remain around 0, regardless of sigma.

When mu is not 0, the mean of the solutions drift toward positive or negative,
proportional to the magnitude of mu.

The variance of the solutions increases linearly in time. The slope of the
increase is proportional to the std of the Gaussian distribution at each step.
