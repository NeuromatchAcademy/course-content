    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain further intuition, let's explore the behavior of such systems with a simple simulation. We can simulate an ordinary differential equation by approximating or modelling time as a discrete list of time steps $t_0, t_1, t_2, \\dots$, such that $t_{i+1}=t_i+dt$. We can get the small change $dx$ over a small duration $dt$ of time from the definition of the differential:\n",

    "This very simple integration scheme, known as **forward Euler integration**, works well if $dt$ is small and the ordinary differential equation is simple. It can run into issues when the ordinary differential equation is very noisy or when the dynamics include sudden big changes of $x$. Such big jumps can occur, for example, in models of excitable neurons. In such cases, one needs to choose an integration scheme carefully. However, for our simple system, the simple integration scheme should work just fine! \n",

For a 2x2 matrix $\\bf A$, a stream plot computes at each position $\\bf x$ a small arrow that indicates $\\bf Ax$ and then connects the small arrows to form _stream lines_. Remember from the beginning of this tutorial that $\\dot {\\bf x} = \\bf Ax$ is the rate of change of $\\bf x$. So the stream lines indicate how a system changes. If you are interested in a particular initial condition ${\\bf x}_0$, just find the correponding position in the stream plot. The stream line that goes through that point in the stream plot indicates ${\\bf x}(t)$."
