    "In this tutorial, we will look at the dynamical systems introduced in the first tutorial through a different lens. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 1, we studied dynamical systems as a deterministic process. For Tutorial 2, we will look at **probabilistic** dynamical systems. You may sometimes hear these systems called _stochastic_. In a probabilistic process, elements of randomness are involved. Every time you observe some probabilistic dynamical system, started from the same initial conditions, the outcome will likely be different. Put another way, dynamical systems that involve probability will incorporate random variations in their behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "For some probabilistic dynamical systems, the differential equations express a relationship between $\\dot{x}$ and $x$ at every time $t$, so that the direction of $x$ at _every_ time depends entirely on the value of $x$. Said a different way, knowledge of the value of the state variables $x$ at time t is _all_ the information needed to determine $\\dot{x}$ and therefore $x$ at the next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property --- that the present state entirely determines the transition to the next state --- is what defines a **Markov process** and systems obeying this property can be described as **Markovian**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Tutorial 2 is to consider this type of Markov process in a simple example where the state transitions are probabilistic. In particular, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand Markov processes and history dependence.\n",
    "* Explore the behavior of a two-state telegraph process and understand how its equilibrium distribution is dependent on its parameters.\n",

You have seen the Poisson process in the [pre-reqs statistics day](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W0D5_Statistics/student/W0D5_Tutorial1.html). The Poisson process is a way to model discrete events where the average time between event occurrences is known but the exact time of some event is not known. Importantly, the Poisson process dictates the following points: \n",
    "1. The probability of some event occurring is _independent from all other events_.\n",
