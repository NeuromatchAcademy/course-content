The fixed points of the single excitatory neuron population are determined by both
recurrent connections w and external input I_ext. In a previous interactive demo
we saw how the system showed two different steady-states when w = 0. But when w
doe not equal 0, for some range of w the system shows three fixed points and the
steady state depends on the initial conditions (i.e.
r at time zero.).
