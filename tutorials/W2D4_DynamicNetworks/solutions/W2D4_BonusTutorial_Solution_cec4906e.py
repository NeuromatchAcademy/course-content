Discussion:

Here we observe a paradoxical effect; if we inject excitatory current to the I
population, the r_I goes down, whereas when we inject inhibitory current, the r_I
increases. Recall that we inject a constant excitatory current to the E population,
which also drives, indirectly, the I population. When Iext>0, the r_I increases
but this drives E to a low state, which in turn leads to rI decrease. Whereas,
when Iext<0, the effect is negative on I population for a short amount of time,
which is sufficient to drive the E population to a high steady state, and then due
to E to I connections, the I population activity is increased.
