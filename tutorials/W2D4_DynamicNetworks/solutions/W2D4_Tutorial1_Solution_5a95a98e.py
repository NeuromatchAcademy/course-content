Discussion:

1) As the F-I curve is bounded between zero and one, the system doesn't explode.
The f-curve guarantees this property

2) One way to increase the maximum response is to change the f-I curve. For
example, the ReLU is an unbounded function, and thus will increase the overall maximal
response of the network.
