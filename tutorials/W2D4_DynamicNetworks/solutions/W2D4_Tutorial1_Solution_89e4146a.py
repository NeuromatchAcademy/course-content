1)  a determines the slope (gain) of the rising phase of the F-I curve

2) theta determines the input at which the function F(x) reaches its mid-value (0.5).
That is, theta shifts the F-I curve along the horizontal axis.

For our neurons we are using in this tutorial:
- a controls the gain of the neuron population
- theta controls the threshold at which the neuron population starts to respond
