Discussion:

When a system has more than one fixed points, depending on the input strength,
the network will settle in one of the fixed points. In this case, we have two
fixed points, one of the fixed points corresponds to high activity. So when input
drives the network to the high activity fixed points, the network activity will
remain there -- it is a stable fixed point. Because the network retains its
activity (persistent activity) even after the input has been removed, we can
take the persistent activity as working memory.
