- For low values of wEE there is only one fixed point and it is stable so initial
conditions do not matter and the system always converge to the only fixed point

- For high values of wEE we have three fixed points of which two are stable and
one is unstable (or saddle). Now it matters where the initial conditions are. If
the initial conditions are in the attractor region os the high activity fixed
point then the system will converge to that (the bottom example).
