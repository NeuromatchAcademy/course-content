Discussion:

- Phase plane portraits allows us to visualize out of all possible states which
states a system can take. For example in this demo you see that the among all
possible pairs of values for r1 and r2, this system can take only a limited number
of states (those that lie on the black line).
- There are other things we can infer from the phase portraits e.g. fixed
points, trajectory to the fixed points etc.
- Explicit information about time is not visible in the phase portraits
