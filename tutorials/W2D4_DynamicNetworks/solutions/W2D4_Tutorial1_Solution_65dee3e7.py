Discussion:

Given the choice of F-I curve (eq 2) and dynamics of the neuron population (eq. 1)
the neurons have two fixed points or steady-state responses irrespective of the input.
- Weak inputs to the neurons eventually result in the activity converging to zero
- Strong inputs to the neurons eventually result in the activity converging to max value

The time constant tau, does not affect the steady-state response but it determines
the time the neurons take to reach to their fixed point.
