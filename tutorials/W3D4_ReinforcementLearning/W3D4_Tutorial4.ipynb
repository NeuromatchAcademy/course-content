    "\n",
    "But what is a model? A model (sometimes called a world model or internal model) is a representation of how the world will respond to the agent's actions. You can think of it as a representation of how the world *works*. With such a representation, the agent can simulate new experiences and learn from these simulations. This is advantageous for two reasons. First, acting in the real world can be costly and sometimes even dangerous: remember Cliff World from Tutorial 3? Learning from simulated experience can avoid some of these costs or risks. Second, simulations make fuller use of one's limited experience. To see why, imagine an agent interacting with the real world. The information acquired with each individual action can only be assimilated at the moment of the interaction. In contrast, the experiences simulated from a model can be simulated multiple times -- and whenever desired -- allowing for the information to be more fully assimilated."

    "# Section 2: Dyna-Q\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will implement Dyna-Q, one of the simplest model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. A Dyna-Q agent combines acting, learning, and planning. The first two components -- acting and learning -- are just like what we have studied previously. Q-learning, for example, learns by acting in the world, and therefore combines acting and learning. But a Dyna-Q agent also implements planning, or simulating experiences from a model--and learns from them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, one can think of a Dyna-Q agent as implementing acting, learning, and planning simultaneously, at all times. But, in practice, one needs to specify the algorithm as a sequence of steps. The most common way in which the Dyna-Q agent is implemented is by adding a planning routine to a Q-learning agent: after the agent acts in the real world and learns from the observed experience, the agent is allowed a series of $k$ *planning steps*. At each one of those $k$ planning steps, the model generates a simulated experience by randomly sampling from the history of all previously experienced state-action pairs. The agent then learns from this simulated experience, again using the same Q-learning rule that you implemented for learning from real experience. This simulated experience is simply a one-step transition, i.e., a state, an action, and the resulting state and reward. So, in practice, a Dyna-Q agent learns (via Q-learning) from one step of **real** experience during acting, and then from k steps of **simulated** experience during planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one final detail about this algorithm: where does the simulated experiences come from or, in other words, what is the \"model\"? In Dyna-Q, as the agent interacts with the environment, the agent also learns the model. For simplicity, Dyna-Q implements model-learning in an almost trivial way, as simply caching the results of each transition. Thus, after each one-step transition in the environment, the agent saves the results of this transition in a big matrix, and consults that matrix during each of the planning steps. Obviously, this model-learning strategy only makes sense if the world is deterministic (so that each state-action pair always leads to the same state and reward), and this is the setting of the exercise below. However, even this simple setting can already highlight one of Dyna-Q major strengths: the fact that the planning is done at the same time as the agent interacts with the environment, which means that new information gained from the interaction may change the model and thereby interact with planning in potentially interesting ways.\n",

Just as above we will have multiple values for $k$, with $k=0$ representing our Q-learning agent and $k=10$ for our Dyna-Q agent with 10 planning steps.

    "In this notebook, you have learned about model-based reinforcement learning and implemented one of the simplest architectures of this type, Dyna-Q. Dyna-Q is very much like Q-learning, but instead of learning only from real experience, you also learn from **simulated** experience. This small difference, however, can have huge benefits! Planning *frees* the agent from the limitation of its own environment, and this in turn allows the agent to speed-up learning -- for instance, effectively incorporating environmental changes into one's policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, model-based RL is an active area of research in machine learning. Some of the exciting topics in the frontier of the field involve (i) learning and representing a complex world model (i.e., beyond the tabular and deterministic case above), and (ii) what to simulate -- also known as search control -- (i.e., beyond the random selection of experiences implemented above).\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework above has also been used in neuroscience to explain various phenomena such as planning, memory sampling, memory consolidation, and even dreaming!"
