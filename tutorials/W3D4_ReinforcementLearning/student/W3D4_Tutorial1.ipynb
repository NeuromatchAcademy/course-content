    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to estimate state-value functions in a classical conditioning paradigm using Temporal Difference (TD) learning and examine TD-errors at the presentation of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus (CS and US) under different CS-US contingencies. These exercises will provide you with an understanding of both how reward prediction errors (RPEs) behave in classical conditioning and what we should expect to see if Dopamine represents a \"canonical\" model-free RPE. \n",

    "At the end of this tutorial:    \n",
    "* You will learn to use the standard tapped delay line conditioning model\n",
    "* You will understand how RPEs move to CS\n",
    "* You will understand how variability in reward size effects RPEs\n",
