    "# Tutorial Objectives\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to act in the more realistic setting of sequential decisions, formalized by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In a sequential decision problem, the actions executed in one state not only may lead to immediate rewards (as in a bandit problem), but may also affect the states experienced next (unlike a bandit problem). Each individual action may therefore affect affect all future rewards. Thus, making decisions in this setting requires considering each action in terms of their expected **cumulative** future reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider here the example of spatial navigation, where actions (movements) in one state (location) affect the states experienced next, and an agent might need to execute a whole sequence of actions before a reward is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will learn\n",
    "* what grid worlds are and how they help in evaluating simple reinforcement learning agents\n",
    "* the basics of the Q-learning algorithm for estimating action values\n",
    "* how the concept of exploration and exploitation, reviewed in the bandit case, also applies to the sequential decision setting"

    "As pointed out, bandits only have a single state and immediate rewards for our actions. Many problems we are interested in have multiple states and delayed rewards, i.e. we won't know if the choices we made will pay off over time, or which actions we took contributed to the outcomes we observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explore these ideas, we turn the a common problem setting: the grid world. Grid worlds are simple environments where each state corresponds to a tile on a 2D grid, and the only actions the agent can take are to move up, down, left, or right across the grid tiles. The agent's job is almost always to find a way to a goal tile in the most direct way possible while overcoming some maze or other obstacles, either static or dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our discussion we will be looking at the classic Cliff World, or Cliff Walker, environment. This is a 4x10 grid with a starting position in the lower-left and the goal position in the lower-right. Every tile between these two is the \"cliff\", and should the agent enter the cliff, they will receive a -100 reward and be sent back to the starting position. Every tile other than the cliff produces a -1 reward when entered. The goal tile ends the episode after taking any action from it.\n",
