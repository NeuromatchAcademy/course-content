    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for defining and solving a problem where an agent learns to take actions that maximize reward. The problem setting is as follows: an agent, biological or artificial, observes the current state of the world and selects an action based on that state. Upon executing an action, the agent receives a reward and uses this information to improve its future actions. Reinforcement learning provides formal, optimal descriptions of learning. These descriptions were first derived from studies of animal behavior and then validated when the formal quantities used in the model were observed in the brain in humans and animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a broad framework and it has deep connections to many topics covered in NMA. For instance, most of reinforcement learning defines the world as a Markov Decision Problem, which is built on Hidden Dynamics and Optimal Control. More broadly, reinforcement learning can be seen as a framework that allows us to bring in many ideas and formalisms from other areas like economics, psychology, computer science, artificial intelligence, etc. to define algorithms or models that can solve large, complex problems with only a simple reward signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will model the agent as an observer that learns to predict future rewards. This agent takes no actions and thus cannot influence how much reward it receives. By predicting how much reward follows from each state, the agent can learn to identify the best states of the world -- i.e. the ones that tend to be followed by the most reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we will learn how to estimate state-value functions in a classical conditioning paradigm using Temporal Difference (TD) learning and examine TD-errors at the presentation of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus (CS and US) under different CS-US contingencies. These exercises will provide you with an understanding of both how reward prediction errors (RPEs) behave in classical conditioning and what we should expect to see if Dopamine represents a \"canonical\" model-free RPE.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this tutorial:\n",
    "* You will learn to use the standard tapped delay line conditioning model\n",
    "* You will understand how RPEs move to CS\n",
    "* You will understand how variability in reward size effects RPEs\n",
    "* You will understand how differences in US-CS timing effect RPEs"

    "Run the cell below to simulate. Recall that earlier in the notebook, we saw that changing $\\alpha$ had little effect on learning in a deterministic environment. In the simulation below, $\\alpha$ is set to 1. What happens when the learning rate is set to such a large value in a probability reward setting? Does it seem like it will _ever_ converge?\n",
    "\n",
    "With a high learning rate, the value function tracks each observed reward, changing quickly whenever there is a reward prediction error. In a probabilistic scenario case, this behavior results in the value function changing too quickly and never stabilizing (converging). Using a low learning rate can stabilize the value function by smoothing out any variation in the reward signal, leading the value function to converge to the average reward over time. However, using a low learning rate can result in slow learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the best of all worlds, it is often useful to use a high learning rate early on (producing fast learning), and to reduce the learning rate gradually throughout learning (so that the value function converges to the average reward). This is sometimes called \"learning rate schedule\"."
