# 1. You would need 2 basis vectors as the true dimensionality of the 2D plane is 2.
# Each vector would have 3 components. The two basic vectors would be independent
# vectors that lie in the 2D plane.

# 2. You can describe the state of the 3 neuron population activity with 2 numbers by
# using the new basis vectors as the coordinate system. We can now describe the neural
# activity in a lower dimensional space because there is lower-dimensional structure.
# We'll learn much more about this, and lots of related interesting research, on the
# dimensionality reduction day in the comp neuro course!
