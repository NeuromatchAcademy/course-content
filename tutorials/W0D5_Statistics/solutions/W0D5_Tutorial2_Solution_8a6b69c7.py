""" You should notice that the parameters estimated by maximum likelihood
estimation/inference are very close to the true parameters (mu = 5, sigma = 1),
as well as the parameters estimated in Coding Exercise 2.1 where all likelihood values
were calculated explicitly. You should also see that changing the mean and
sigma parameter values (and generating new data from a distribution with these
parameters) makes no difference as MLE methods can still recover these
parameters.
