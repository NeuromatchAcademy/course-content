Hopefully you can see that the blue line stays a little closer to the true values ($\mu=5$, $\sigma^2=1$).

 Having a simple prior in the Bayesian inference process (blue) helps to regularise
 the inference of the mean and variance parameters when you have very little data,
 but has little effect with large data sets. You can see that as the number of data points
 (x-axis) increases, both inference processes (blue and red lines) get closer and closer
 together, i.e. their estimates for the true parameters converge as sample size increases.
