""" You will learn more about "Bayesian brains" and the theory surrounding
these ideas once the course begins. Here is a brief explanation: it may
be ideal for human brains to implement Bayesian inference by integrating "prior"
information the brain has about the world (memories, prior knowledge, etc.) with
new evidence that updates its "beliefs"/prior. This process seems to parallel
the brain's method of learning about its environment, making it a compelling
theory for many neuroscience researchers. One of Bonus exercises below examines a possible
real world model for Bayesian inference: sound localization.
