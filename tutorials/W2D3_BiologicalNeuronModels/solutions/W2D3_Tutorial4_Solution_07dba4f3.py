Discussion:

1. Yes. Because
a. area under the STDP curve is negative
b. synapses are set to their maximum possible weight.
c. presynaptic neurons have a variance in their firing rates because of Poisson nature

2. g_E will fluctuate even when synapses do not show any STDP because of the Poisson
nature but with STDP, there will be bigger fluctuations as synaptic weight will
vary on spike by spike basis.

3. Individual synaptic weight will always fluctuate but the synaptic weight
distribution will reach a steady state.
