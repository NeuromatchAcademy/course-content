1) If we have bigger current fluctuations (increased sigma), the minimum input needed
to make a neuron spike is smaller as the fluctuations can help push the voltage above
threshold.

2) The standard deviation (or size of current fluctuations) dictates the level of
irregularity of the spikes; the higher the sigma the more irregular the observed
spikes.
