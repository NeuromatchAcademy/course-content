Discussion:

Because we have a facilitatory synapses, as the input rate increases synaptic
resources released per spike also increase. Therefore, we expect that the synaptic
conductance will increase with input rate. However, total synaptic resources are
finite. And they recover in a finite time. Therefore, at high frequency inputs
synaptic resources are rapidly deleted at a higher rate than their recovery, so
after first few spikes, only a small number of synaptic resources are left. This
results in decrease in the steady-state synaptic conductance at high frequency inputs.
