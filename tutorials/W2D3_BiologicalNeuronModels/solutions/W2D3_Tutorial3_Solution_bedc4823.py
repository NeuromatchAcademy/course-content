Discussion:

Increasing the input rate, we decrease the synaptic efficacy, i.e., the synaptic
conductance decreases. This is the case for both Poisson or a regular spiking input.
In case of regular spiking, the synaptic conductance reaches a steady state. This
will not happen in the case of Poisson type spikes.
