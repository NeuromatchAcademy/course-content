When the mean FMP is above spike threshold, the fluctuations in the FMP are rather small,
and the neuron spikes in a fairly regular fashion. This regime, where the mean FMP
is above the spike threshold, is called **mean-driven regime**.

When the mean FMP is below the spike threshold, the fluctuations in the FMP are
large, and the neuron's spikes are driven by these fluctuations. As a consequence,
the neuron spikes in more  Poisson-like fashion. This regime, where the mean FMP is
below the spike threshold, and spikes are driven by the fluctuations, is called **fluctuation-driven regime**.
