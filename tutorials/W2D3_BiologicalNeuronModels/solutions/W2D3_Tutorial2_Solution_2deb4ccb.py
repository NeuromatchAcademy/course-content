Discussion: This has got to do with which part of the input current distribution
is transferred to the spiking activity.

Intuitive understanding is difficult but this relationship arises due to non-linearities
in the neuron F-I curve.  When F-I curve is linear, output correlation is independent
of the mean and standard deviation. But this relationship arises even in neurons with
threshold-linear F-I curve.

neural spike trains increases with firing rate. Nature. 2007 Aug;448(7155):802-6.
