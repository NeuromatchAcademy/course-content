    "# Tutorial Objectives\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on building a model of a synapse in which its synaptic strength changes as a function of the relative timing (i.e., time difference) between the spikes of the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, respectively. This change in the synaptic weight is known as **spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goals for this tutorial are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- build a model of synapse that show STDP\n",
    "\n",
    "- study how correlations in input spike trains influence the distribution of synaptic weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards these goals, we will model the presynaptic input as Poisson type spike trains. The postsynaptic neuron will be modeled as an LIF neuron (see Tutorial 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we assume that a single postsynaptic neuron is driven by $N$ presynaptic neurons. That is, there are $N$ synapses, and we will study how their weights depend on the statistics or the input spike trains and their timing with respect to the spikes of the postsynaptic neuron.\n"

    "Finally, to implement STDP in spiking networks, we will change the value of the peak synaptic conductance based on the presynaptic and postsynaptic timing, thus using the variables $P(t)$ and $M(t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each synapse $i$ has its own peak synaptic conductance ($\\bar g_i$), which may vary between $[0, \\bar g_{max}]$, and will be modified depending on the presynaptic and postsynaptic timing. \n",
    "\n",
    "* When the $i_{th}$ presynaptic neuron elicits a spike, its corresponding peak conductance is updated according to the following equation:\n",

    "  \\bar g_i = \\bar g_i + M(t)\\bar g_{max}\n",
    "  \\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "  \\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note that, $M(t)$ tracks the time since the last postsynaptic potential and is always negative. Hence, if *the postsynaptic neuron spikes shortly before the presynaptic neuron*, the above equation shows that the peak conductance will decrease. \n",
