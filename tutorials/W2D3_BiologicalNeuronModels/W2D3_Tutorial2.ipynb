    "# Section 1: Correlations (Synchrony)\n",
    "Correlation or synchrony in neuronal activity can be described for any readout of brain activity. Here, we are concerned with the spiking activity of neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest way, correlation/synchrony refers to coincident spiking of neurons, i.e., when two neurons spike together, they are firing in **synchrony** or are **correlated**. Neurons can be synchronous in their instantaneous activity, i.e., they spike together with some probability. However, it is also possible that spiking of a neuron at time $t$ is correlated with the spikes of another neuron with a delay (time-delayed synchrony). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Origin of synchronous neuronal activity:\n",
    "- Common inputs, i.e., two neurons are receiving input from the same sources. The degree of correlation of the shared inputs is proportional to their output correlation.\n",
    "- Pooling from the same sources. Neurons do not share the same input neurons but are receiving inputs from neurons which themselves are correlated.\n",
    "- Neurons are connected to each other (uni- or bi-directionally): This will only give rise to time-delayed synchrony. Neurons could also be connected via gap-junctions.\n",
    "- Neurons have similar parameters and initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications of synchrony\n",
    "When neurons spike together, they can have a stronger impact on downstream neurons. Synapses in the brain are sensitive to the temporal correlations (i.e., delay) between pre- and postsynaptic activity, and this, in turn, can lead to the formation of functional neuronal networks - the basis of unsupervised learning (we will study some of these concepts in a forthcoming tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchrony implies a reduction in the dimensionality of the system. In addition, correlations, in many cases, can impair the decoding of neuronal activity."

    "The _sample correlation coefficient_ between two input currents $I_i$ and $I_j$ is defined as the sample covariance of $I_i$ and $I_j$ divided by the square root of the sample variance of $I_i$ multiplied with the square root of the sample variance of $I_j$. In equation form:  \n",

Note that the equations above are not accurate for sample covariances and variances as they should be additionally divided by L-1 - we have dropped this term because it cancels out in the sample correlation coefficient formula.\n",

    "The _sample correlation coefficient_ may also be referred to as the _sample Pearson correlation coefficient_. Here, is a beautiful paper that explains multiple ways to calculate and understand correlations [Rodgers and Nicewander 1988](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~rabbee/correlation.pdf).\n",

    "In this exercise, we will create a function, `my_CC` to compute the sample correlation coefficient between two time series. Note that while we introduced this computation here in the context of input currents, the sample correlation coefficient is used to compute the correlation between any two time series - we will use it later on binned spike trains.  \n",

    "We then check our method is accurate by generating currents with a certain correlation (using `correlate_input`), computing the correlation coefficient using `my_CC`, and plotting the true vs sample correlation coefficients."
