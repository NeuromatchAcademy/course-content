To better appreciate what is happening here, you should go back to the previous 
interactive demo. Set the w = 5 and I_ext = 0.5.

You will find that there are three fixed points of the system for these values of
w and I_ext. Now, choose the initial value in this demo and see in which direction 
the system output moves. When r_init is in the vicinity of the leftmost fixed points 
it moves towards the left most fixed point. When r_init is in the vicinity of the 
rightmost fixed points it moves towards the rightmost fixed point.
