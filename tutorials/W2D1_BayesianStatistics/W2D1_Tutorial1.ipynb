    "This is the first in a series of three main tutorials (+ one bonus tutorial) on Bayesian statistics. In these tutorials, we will develop a Bayesian model for localizing sounds based on audio and visual cues. This model will combine **prior** information about where sounds generally originate with sensory information about the **likelihood** that a specific sound came from a particular location. As we will see in subsequent lessons, the resulting **posterior distribution** not only allows us to make optimal decision about the sound's origin, but also lets us quantify how uncertain that decision is. Bayesian techniques are therefore useful **normative models**: the behavior of human or animal subjects can be compared against these models to determine how efficiently they make use of information. \n",

    "This notebook will introduce two fundamental building blocks for Bayesian statistics: the Gaussian distribution and the Bayes Theorem. You will: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a Gaussian distribution\n",
    "2. Use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior from a Gaussian-distributed prior and likelihood. \n",
    "3. Change the likelihood mean and variance and observe how posterior changes.\n",
    "4. Advanced (*optional*): Observe what happens if the prior is a mixture of two gaussians?\n"

    "# Section 1: The Gaussian Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian analysis operates on probability distributions. Although these can take many forms, the Gaussian distribution is a very common choice. Because of the central limit theorem, many quantities are Gaussian-distributed. Gaussians also have some mathematical properties that permit simple closed-form solutions to several important problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement a Gaussian by filling in the missing portion of `my_gaussian` below. Gaussians have two parameters. The **mean** $\\mu$, which sets the location of its center. Its \"scale\" or spread is controlled by its **standard deviation** $\\sigma$ or its square, the **variance** $\\sigma^2$. (Be careful not to use one when the other is required). \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for a Gaussian is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{-(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Also, don't forget that this is a probability distribution and should therefore sum to one. While this happens \"automatically\" when integrated from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$, your version will only be computed over a finite number of points. You therefore need to explicitly normalize it yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Test out your implementation with a $\\mu = -1$ and $\\sigma = 1$. After you have it working, play with the  parameters to develop an intuition for how changing $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ alter the shape of the Gaussian. This is important, because subsequent exercises will be built out of Gaussians. "

We can directly compute the  parameters of that Gaussian from the means and variances of the prior and likelihood. For example, the posterior mean is given by:\n",
