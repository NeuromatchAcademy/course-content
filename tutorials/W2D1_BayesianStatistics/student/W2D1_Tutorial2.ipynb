    "# Section 1: Motivating example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ventriloquists produce the illusion that their puppets are talking because:\n",
    "1. We observe the visual input of the puppet moving its mouth, as if speaking.\n",
    "2. The speech that the puppeteer generates originates near the puppet's mouth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are accustomed to voices coming from moving mouths, we tend to interpret the voice as coming directly from the puppet itself rather than from the puppeteer (who is also hiding his/her own mouth movements). In the remaining tutorials, we will study how this illusion breaks down as the distance between the visual stimulus (the puppet's mouth) and the auditory stimulus (the puppeter's concealed speech) changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an experiment where participants are shown a puppet moving its mouth at a location directly in front of them (at position 0˚). The subjects are told that 75% of the time, the voice they hear originates from the puppet. On the remaining 25% of trials, sounds come from elsewhere. Participants learn this over multiple trials, after which a curtain is dropped in front of the puppeteer and the puppet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we present only the auditory stimulus at varying locations and we ask participants to report where the source of the sound is located. The participants have access to two pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The prior information about sound localization, learned during the trials before the curtain fell.\n",
    "*   Their noisy sensory estimates about where a particular sound originates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our eventual goal, which we achieve in Tutorial 3, is to predict the subjects' responses: when do subjects ascribe a sound to the puppet, and when do they believe it originated elsewhere? Doing so requires building a prior that captures the participant's knowledge and expectations, which we wil do in the exercises that follow here. "

    "# Section 2: Mixture-of-Gaussians Prior\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, you learned how to create a single Gaussian prior that could represent one of these possibilties. A broad Gaussian with a large $\\sigma$ could represent sounds originating from nearly anywhere, while a narrow Gaussian with $\\mu$ near zero could represent sounds orginating from the puppet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will combine those into a mixure-of-Gaussians probability density function (PDF) that captures both possibilties. We will control how the Gaussians are mixed by summing them together with a 'mixing' or weight parameter $p_{common}$, set to a value between 0 and 1, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "    \\text{Mixture} = \\bigl[\\; p_{common} \\times \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{common},\\sigma_{common}) \\; \\bigr] + \\bigl[ \\;\\underbrace{(1-p_{common})}_{p_{independent}} \\times \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{independent},\\sigma_{independent}) \\; \\bigr]\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{common}$ denotes the probability that auditory stimulus shares a \"common\" source with the learnt visual input; in other words, the probability that the \"puppet\" is speaking. You might think that we need to include a separate weight for the possibility that sound is \"independent\" from the puppet. nHowever, since there are only two, mutually-exclusive possibilties, we can replace $p_{independent}$ with $(1 - p_{common})$ since, by the law of total probability, $p_{common} + p_{independent}$ must equal one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula above, complete the code to build this mixture-of-Gaussians PDF: \n",
    "* Generate a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5 to be the 'common' part of the Gaussian mixture prior. (This is already done for you below).\n",
    "* Generate another Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 3 to serve as the 'independent' part. \n",
    "* Combine the two Gaussians to make a new prior by mixing the two Gaussians with mixing parameter $p_{common}$ = 0.75 so that the peakier \"common-cause\" Gaussian has 75% of the weight. Don't forget to normalize afterwards! \n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "* Code for the `my_gaussian` function from Tutorial 1 is available for you to use. Its documentation is below. \n"
