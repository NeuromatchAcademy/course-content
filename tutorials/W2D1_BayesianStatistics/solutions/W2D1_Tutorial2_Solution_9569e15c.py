"""
The mixture of Gaussian prior creates some interesting behaviour: 
  1. We observe multiple modes (i.e. peaks) in our posterior
  (the common and independent causes). 
  2. The mode of the posterior jumps between stimulus locations. These 
  correspond to the participant switching from the independent to the common 
  parts (i.e. causes) of the prior. 

A similar discontinuity (ie. 'jump') in the posterior mode would happen in the 
case of cue combination illusion with the puppet and puppeteer voice. 
The illusion that the puppet is generating the speech would break-down when the
voice stimulus is presented too far away from the visual input (the puppet's 
location).
