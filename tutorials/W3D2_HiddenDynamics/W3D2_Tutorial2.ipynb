    "The world around us is often changing state over time, but we may only have access to these states through noisy sensory measurements. Similarly, organisms and neural systems often are thought to transition between a set of discrete states (up/down states, sleep/wake, etc.) which may only be indirectly observable through their impact on neural activity. Hidden Markov Models are a class of models that allow us to reason about the dynamics of a set of unobserved states that lead to the changing sensory inputs or data we observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll first simulate a Hidden Markov Model and observe how changing the transition probability and observation noise impact what the samples look like. Then we'll look at how uncertainty increases as we make future predictions without evidence (from observations) and how to gain information from the observations.\n",
    "The HMM model we use in the first part of the tutorial will have binary latent variable $x_t \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and 1D Gaussian emmision model $y_t|x_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{x_t},\\sigma^2_{x_t})$. You will learn how to:\n",

    "* Build an HMM in Python and generate sample data.\n",

    "* Combine new evidence and prediction from past evidence  to estimate latent states.\n",

    "In contrast with the Sequential Probability Ratio Test, the latent state in HMMs is no longer fixed over time. Instead, it can probabilistically switch or jump to a different state at each time step. However, the  time dependence of states at different times is simple: the probability of the state at time $t$ is totally determined by the state at time $t-1$. This is called called the **Markov property** or **Markovian** and the dependency of the whole state sequence $\\{x_1,...,x_t\\}$ can be described by a chain structure called a Markov Chain:\n",

    "Quantitatively, assuming we are at state $i$ at time $t-1$, and denote the probability to jump to state $j$ at next time point $t$ as $A_{ij}$, then the distribution at time $t$ can be calculated using only probabilities at $t-1$ and the transition matrix $A$:\n",

    "\n",
    "We cannot directly observe the latent states $x_t$. What we can observe instead is a noisy measurement $y_t$ generated from $x_t$. Common choices of measurement/emission models include Gaussian distribution $y_t|x_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{x_t},\\sigma^2_{x_t})$ for continuous observables, and Poisson distribution $y_t|x_t \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda)$ for discrete observables (like spike counts).\n",

    "In this exercise, you will use the package `hmmlearn` to implement a two-state HMM with Gaussian emissions. Your HMM will start in State 0 and transition between states (both $0 \\rightarrow 1$ and $1 \\rightarrow 0$) with probability `switch_prob`. Each state emits observations drawn from a Gaussian with $\\mu = 1$ for State 0 and $\\mu = -1$ for State 1. The variance of both states is fixed at `noise_level`.\n",

    "2. The *hidden* part of HMM means that we do not directly output the current state $x_t$, but instead observe a noisy emission $y_t | x_t$, here generated by a Gaussian. The  means have already been filled in for you, but you must complete the covariance matrix `covars_`. Set each state's observation variance to `noise_level`. The required shape, given below, is unusual, but don't overthink finding the (co)variance of a univariate Gaussian. \n",

    "Given noisy neural or behavioral measurements, we as neuroscientists often want to infer the unobserved latent variables as they change over time. Thalamic relay neurons fire in two distinct modes: a tonic mode where spikes are produced one at a time, and a 'burst mode' where several action potentials are produced in rapid succession. These modes are thought to differentially encode how the neurons relay information from sensory receptors to cortex. A distinct molecular mechanism, T-type calcium channels, switches neurons between modes, but it is very challenging to measure in the brain of a living monkey. However, statistical approaches let us recover the hidden state of those calcium channels purely from their spiking activity, which can be measured in a behaving monkey.\n",
