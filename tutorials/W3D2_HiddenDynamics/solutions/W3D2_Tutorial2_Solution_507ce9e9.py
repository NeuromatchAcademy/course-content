1) With 0 switching probability, the HMM stays
in one state the whole time. With switching probability of 1, the HMM switches state
every single step.

2) With high noise, the measurements don't track the underlying latent state very well. With
low noise the latent state plot (green) and measurement plot (blue) look identical
