    "The faster you make a decision, the lower your accuracy often is. This phenomenon is known as the **speed/accuracy tradeoff**. Humans can make this tradeoff in a wide range of situations, and many animal species, including ants, bees, rodents, and monkeys also show similar effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the speed/accuracy tradeoff under thresholding stopping rule, let's run some simulations under different thresholds and look at how average decision \"speed\" (1/length) changes with average decision accuracy. We use speed rather than accuracy because in real experiments, subjects can be incentivized to respond faster or slower; it's much harder to precisely control their decision time or error threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete the function `simulate_accuracy_vs_threshold` to simulate and compute average accuracies vs. average decision lengths for a list of error thresholds. You will need to supply code to calculate average decision 'speed' from the lengths of trials. You should also calculate the overall accuracy across these trials. \n",
