Although the dots' velocity varies from trial to trial, the set of all $v_i$ are  generated by a fixed probability distribution, which we know to be either:\n",

    "If you stop taking samples too early, (e.g., make a decision after only seeing 5 samples), or there's a huge amount of observation noise that buries the signal, you are likely to be driven by observation noise to a negative cumulated log likelihood ratio and thus make a wrong decision. You could get a sense of this by increasing noise level or decreasing stopping time in the last exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at how decision accuracy varies with the number of samples we see quantitatively. First we'll fix our observation noise level. In this exercise you will run several repeated simulations for a certain stopping time to calculate the average decision accuracy. Accuracy is simply defined as the proportion of correct trials across our repeated simulations: $\\frac{\\# \\textrm{ correct decisions}}{\\# \\textrm{ total simulation runs}}$\n",
