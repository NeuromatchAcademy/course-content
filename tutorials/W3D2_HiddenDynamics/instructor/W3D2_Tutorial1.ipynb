    "On Bayes Day, we learned how to combine the sensory measurement $m$ about a latent variable $s$ with our prior knowledge, using Bayes' Theorem. This produced a posterior probability distribution $p(s|m)$. Today we will allow for _dynamic_ world states and measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 1 we will assume that the world state is _binary_ ($\\pm 1$) and _constant_ over time, but allow for multiple observations over time. We will use the *Sequential Probability Ratio Test* (SPRT) to infer which state is true. This leads to the *Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)* where evidence accumulates until reaching a stopping criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Define and implement the Sequential Probability Ratio Test for a series of measurements\n",
    "- Define what drift and diffusion mean in a drift-diffusion model\n",
    "- Explain the speed-accuracy trade-off in a drift diffusion model\n",

We do this by computing a likelihood ratio: the ratio of the likelihood of all these measurements given the state is +1, $p(m_{1:t}|s=+1)$, to the likelihood of the measurements given the state is -1, $p(m_{1:t}|s=-1)$.

The observer must guess the direction. Neurons in the brain are informative about this task, and have responses that correlate with the choice, as predicted by the Drift Diffusion Model (Huk and Shadlen 2005).\n",
