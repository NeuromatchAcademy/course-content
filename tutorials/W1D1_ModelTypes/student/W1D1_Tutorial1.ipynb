In this study, Neuropixels probes were implanted in the brains of mice. Electrical potentials were measured by hundreds of electrodes along the length of each probe. Each electrode's measurements captured local variations in the electric field due to nearby spiking neurons. A spike sorting algorithm was used to infer spike times and cluster spikes according to common origin: a single cluster of sorted spikes is causally attributed to a single neuron.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we loaded some neural data and poked at it to understand how the dataset is organized. Then we made some basic plots to visualize (1) the average level of activity across the population and (2) the distribution of ISIs for an individual neuron. In the very last bit, we started to think about using mathematical formalisms to understand or explain some physiological phenomenon. All of this only allowed us to understand \"What\" the data looks like.\n",
