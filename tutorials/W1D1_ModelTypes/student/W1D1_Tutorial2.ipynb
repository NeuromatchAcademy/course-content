    "# Section 1: The Linear Integrate-and-Fire Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a neuron spike? \n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron charges and discharges an electric field across its cell membrane. The state of this electric field can be described by the _membrane potential_. The membrane potential rises due to excitation of the neuron, and when it reaches a threshold a spike occurs. The potential resets, and must rise to a threshold again before the next spike occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest models of spiking neuron behavior is the linear integrate-and-fire model neuron. In this model, the neuron increases its membrane potential $V_m$ over time in response to excitatory input currents $I$ scaled by some factor $\\alpha$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  dV_m = {\\alpha}I\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Once $V_m$ reaches a threshold value a spike is produced, $V_m$ is reset to a starting value, and the process continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will take the starting and threshold potentials as $0$ and $1$, respectively. So, for example, if $\\alpha I=0.1$ is constant---that is, the input current is constant---then $dV_m=0.1$, and at each timestep the membrane potential $V_m$ increases by $0.1$ until after $(1-0)/0.1 = 10$ timesteps it reaches the threshold and resets to $V_m=0$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we define the membrane potential $V_m$ as a scalar: a single real (or floating point) number. However, a biological neuron's membrane potential will not be exactly constant at all points on its cell membrane at a given time. We could capture this variation with a more complex model (e.g. with more numbers). Do we need to? \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed model is a 1D simplification. There are many details we could add to it, to preserve different parts of the complex structure and dynamics of a real neuron. If we were interested in small or local changes in the membrane potential, our 1D simplification could be a problem. However, we'll assume an idealized \"point\" neuron model for our current purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spiking Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our simplified model for the neuron dynamics, we still need to consider what form the input $I$ will take. How should we specify the firing behavior of the presynaptic neuron(s) providing the inputs to our model neuron? \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in the simple example above, where $\\alpha I=0.1$, the input current is generally not constant. Physical inputs tend to vary with time. We can describe this variation with a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll assume the input current $I$ over a timestep is due to equal contributions from a non-negative ($\\ge 0$) integer number of input spikes arriving in that timestep. Our model neuron might integrate currents from 3 input spikes in one timestep, and 7 spikes in the next timestep. We should see similar behavior when sampling from our distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given no other information about the input neurons, we will also assume that the distribution has a mean (i.e. mean rate, or number of spikes received per timestep), and that the spiking events of the input neuron(s) are independent in time. Are these reasonable assumptions in the context of real neurons?\n",
    "\n",
    "A suitable distribution given these assumptions is the Poisson distribution, which we'll use to model $I$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  I \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the mean of the distribution: the average rate of spikes received per timestep."

First, we built a simple neuron model with excitatory input and saw that it's behavior, measured using the ISI distribution, did not match our real neurons. We then improved our model by adding leakiness and inhibitory input. The behavior of this balanced model was much closer to the real neural data."

    "### Why do neurons spike?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron stores energy in an electric field across its cell membrane, by controlling the distribution of charges (ions) on either side of the membrane. This energy is rapidly discharged to generate a spike when the field potential (or membrane potential) crosses a threshold. The membrane potential may be driven toward or away from this threshold, depending on inputs from other neurons: excitatory or inhibitory, respectively. The membrane potential tends to revert to a resting potential, for example due to the leakage of ions across the membrane, so that reaching the spiking threshold depends not only on the amount of input ever received following the last spike, but also the timing of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The storage of energy by maintaining a field potential across an insulating membrane can be modeled by a capacitor. The leakage of charge across the membrane can be modeled by a resistor. This is the basis for the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model."

    "In our above examples we set many of these parameters to convenient values ($C_m = R_m = dt = 1$, $V_{rest} = 0$) to focus more on the general behavior of the model. However, these too can be manipulated to achieve different dynamics, or to ensure the dimensions of the problem are preserved between simulation units and experimental units (e.g. with $V_m$ given in millivolts, $R_m$ in megaohms, $t$ in milliseconds)."
