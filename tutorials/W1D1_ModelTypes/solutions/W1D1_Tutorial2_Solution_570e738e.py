1. Raising the excitatory rate while keeping inhibitory rate the same results in
more frequent firing and shorter ISIs. This makes intuitive sense - more excitatory input
means higher responses.
2. Raising the inhibitory rate while keeping the excitatory rate the same results
in less frequent firing and longer ISIs. This makes intuitive sense - more inhibitory input
means lower responses.
3. If the excitatory and inhibitory rates are equal, the average inter-spike interval
stays the same even if you raise both. This is because they balance each other out.
4. Yes, these ISIs look more exponential, like what we observed.
