1. The spikes are pretty predictable - they occur at fairly regular intervals.
2. Raising alpha increases the rate of spikes (and thus decreases the inter-spike intervals)
3. Raising the rate increases the rate of spikes (and thus decreases the inter-spike intervals)
These two facts make sense because they both control the size of the input affecting the neuron - more
input means higher responses.
4. No, the ISIs look pretty symmetrical and Gaussian (not exponential)
