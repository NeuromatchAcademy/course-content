In this study, Neuropixels probes were implanted in the brains of mice. Electrical potentials were measured by hundreds of electrodes along the length of each probe. Each electrode's measurements captured local variations in the electric field due to nearby spiking neurons. A spike sorting algorithm was used to infer spike times and cluster spikes according to common origin: a single cluster of sorted spikes is causally attributed to a single neuron.\n",
