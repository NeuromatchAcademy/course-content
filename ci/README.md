# Continuous Integration Infrastructure

The scripts in this directory implement the continuous integration (CI) pipeline for testing and building the tutorial notebooks.

Consult the [content pipeline documentation](../organization/Tutorial_Pipeline.md) for a high-level overview of the steps, and see the GitHub Action [workflow file](../.github/workflows/notebook-pr.yaml) for the full context of each script's execution.
